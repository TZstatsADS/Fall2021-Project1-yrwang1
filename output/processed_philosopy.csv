plato,-350,"the same things then are loved by the gods and hated by the gods, and would be both god loved and god hated.",ancient
plato,-350,"i did not ask you what same thing is both pious and impious, and it appears that what is loved by the gods is also hated by them.",ancient
plato,-350,"this action would then, it seems, be hated by the gods, but the pious and the impious were not thereby now defined, for what is hated by the gods has also been shown to be loved by them.'",ancient
plato,-350,"however, is this the correction we are making in our discussion, that what all the gods hate is impious, and what they all love is pious, and that what some gods love and others hate is neither or both?",ancient
plato,-350,"i would certainly say that the pious is what all the gods love, and the opposite, what all the gods hate, is the impious.",ancient
plato,-350,"is the pious being loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is being loved by the gods?",ancient
plato,-350,so there is also something loved and a different thing something loving.,ancient
plato,-350,is something loved either something changed or something affected by something?,ancient
plato,-350,"so it is in the same case as the things just mentioned; it is not being loved by those who love it because it is something loved, but it is something loved because it is being loved by them?",ancient
plato,-350,"surely that it is being loved by all the gods, according to what you say?",ancient
plato,-350,"is it being loved because it is pious, or for some other reason?",ancient
plato,-350,"it is being loved then because it is pious, but it is not pious because it is being loved?",ancient
plato,-350,and yet it is something loved and god loved because it is being loved by the gods?,ancient
plato,-350,"then the god loved is not the same as the pious, euthyphro, nor the pious the same as the god loved, as you say it is, but one differs from the other.",ancient
plato,-350,"because we agree that the pious is being loved for this reason, that it is pious, but it is not pious because it is being loved.",ancient
plato,-350,"and that the god loved, on the other hand, is so because it is being loved by the gods, by the very fact of being loved, but it is not being loved because it is god loved.",ancient
plato,-350,"but if the god loved and the pious were the same, my dear euthyphro, then if the pious was being loved because it was pious, the god loved would also be being loved because it was god loved; and if the god loved was god loved because it was being loved by the gods, then.",ancient
plato,-350,euthyphro the pious would also be pious because it was being loved by the gods.,ancient
plato,-350,"but now you see that they are in opposite cases as being altogether different from each other: the one is such as to be loved because it is being loved, the other is being loved because it is such as to be loved.",ancient
plato,-350,"i'm afraid, euthyphro, that when you were asked what piety is, you did not wish to make its nature clear to me, but you told me an affect or quality of it, that the pious has the quality of being loved by all the gods, but you have not yet told me what the pious is.",ancient
plato,-350,"what piety is, whether being loved by the gods or having some other quality we shall not quarrel about that but be keen to tell me what the pious and the impious are.",ancient
plato,-350,"as it is, the lover of inquiry must follow his beloved wherever it may lead him.",ancient
plato,-350,you surely remember that earlier the pious and the godloved were shown not to be the same but different from each other.,ancient
plato,-350,is this not the same as the god loved?,ancient
plato,-350,"it seems likely that we shall, only then, when we are dead, attain that which we desire and of which we claim to be lovers, namely, wisdom, as our argument shows, not while we live; for if it is impossible to attain any pure knowledge with the body, then one of two things is true:",ancient
plato,-350,"such are the things, simmias, that all those who love learning in the proper manner must say to one another and believe.",ancient
plato,-350,"many men, at the death of their lovers, wives or sons, were willing to go to the underworld, driven by the hope of seeing there those for whose company they longed, and being with them.",ancient
plato,-350,"will then a true lover of wisdom, who has a similar hope and knows that he will never find it to any extent except in hades, be resentful of dying and not gladly undertake the journey thither?",ancient
plato,-350,"then you have sufficient indication, he said, that any man whom you see resenting death was not a lover of wisdom but a lover of the body, and also a lover of wealth or of honors, either or both.",ancient
plato,-350,"well, you know what happens to lovers: whenever they see a lyre, a garment or anything else that their beloved is accustomed to use, they know the lyre, and the image of the boy to whom it belongs comes into their mind.",ancient
plato,-350,"no one may join the company of the gods who has not practiced philosophy and is not completely pure when he departs from life, no one but the lover of learning.",ancient
plato,-350,"it is for this reason, my friends simmias and cebes, that those who practice philosophy in the right way keep away from all bodily passions, master them and do not surrender themselves to them; it is not at all for fear of wasting their substance and of poverty, which the majority and the money lovers fear, nor for fear of dishonor and ill repute, like the ambitious and lovers of honors, that they keep away from them.",ancient
plato,-350,"the lovers of learning know that when philosophy gets hold of their soul, it is imprisoned in and clinging to the body, and that it is forced to examine other things through it as through a cage and not by itself, and that it wallows in every kind of ignorance.",ancient
plato,-350,"as i say, the lovers of learning know that philosophy gets hold of their soul when it is in that state, then gently encourages it and tries to free it by showing them that investigation through the eyes is full of deceit, as is that through the ears and the other senses.",ancient
plato,-350,"this is why genuine lovers of learning are moderate and brave, or do you think it is for the reasons the majority says they are?",ancient
plato,-350,"i know that others drink the poison quite a long time after they have received the order, eating and drinking quite a bit, and some of them enjoy intimacy with their loved ones.",ancient
plato,-350,"then he shouldn't be called 'theophilus' ('god beloved') or 'mnesitheus' ('mindful of god'), or anything of that sort, but something that signifies the opposite, if indeed names are to be actually correct.",ancient
plato,-350,"many, too, are given in the hope that they will prove appropriate, such as 'eutychides' ('son of good fortune'), 'sosias' ('saviour'), 'theophilus' ('god beloved'), and many others.",ancient
plato,-350,it expresses the fact that heroes were born out of love (ero?s).,ancient
plato,-350,so all of them sprang from the love of a god for a mortal woman or of a mortal man for a goddess.,ancient
plato,-350,"and if, as before, you investigate the matter by relying on old attic, you will get a better understanding, since it will show you that the name 'hero' ('he?ro?s') is only a slightly altered form of the word 'love' ('ero?s')",ancient
plato,-350,"demeter seems to have been so called because she gives (didousa) nourishment just like a mother (me?te?r); hera is a loveable one (erate?), and, indeed, zeus is said to have married her for love.",ancient
plato,-350,"you'll have to ask others for the serious one, but there's nothing to prevent us from going through the playful one even the gods love play.",ancient
plato,-350,"ero?s (erotic love) is so called because it flows in from outside, that is to say, the flow doesn't belong to the person who has it, but is introduced into him through his eyes.",ancient
plato,-350,"but, as it is, i love athens better than cyrene, and so i'm more anxious to know which of our young men show signs of turning out well.",ancient
plato,-350,"and if he were beautiful, i should be extremely nervous of speaking of him with enthusiasm, for fear i might be suspected of being in love with him.",ancient
plato,-350,"theodorus, i hope my love of argument is not making me forget my manners just because i'm so anxious to start a discussion and get us all friendly and talkative together?",ancient
plato,-350,"you are the complete lover of discussion, theodorus, and it is too good of you to think that i am a sort of bag of arguments, and can easily pick one out which will show you that this theory is wrong.",ancient
plato,-350,it seems you aren't paying attention to the way lovers hunt.,ancient
plato,-350,let's call this type expertise in love.,ancient
plato,-350,and you'll assign this dialectical activity only to someone who has a pure and just love of wisdom.,ancient
plato,-350,"ibycus compares himself to a horse a champion but no longer young, on the point of drawing a chariot in a race and trembling at what experience tells him is about to happen and says that he himself, old man that he is, is being forced against his will to compete in love's game.",ancient
plato,-350,c.) was best known for his love poems.,ancient
plato,-350,"(we know nothing of philebus, apart from this dialogue: his name means 'youth lover' and so pleasure seeker, and he is presented as himself an attractive young man.",ancient
plato,-350,for we are not contending here out of love of victory for my suggestion to win or for yours.,ancient
plato,-350,"but if pleasure were also deprived of second prize, she would definitely be somewhat dishonored in the eyes of her own lovers, nor would she seem as fair to them as before.",ancient
plato,-350,"is not a man who is just, pious, and good in all respects, also loved by the gods?",ancient
plato,-350,"take wrath, fear, longing, lamentations, love, jealousy, malice, and other things like that; don't you regard them as a kind of pain within the soul itself?",ancient
plato,-350,"now, we had on our list of examples wrath, longing, lamentations, fear, love, jealousy, malice, and whatever else, and we said that in these cases we would discern the mixture that we have already mentioned so frequently,",ancient
plato,-350,don't you see that it was designed to make it easier to persuade you that there is such a mixture in fear and love and other cases?,ancient
plato,-350,"we must have met handsome and noble youths, together with their courageous lovers.",ancient
plato,-350,"we must look for this science without concern for its actual benefit or its prestige, but see whether it is by its nature a capacity in our soul to love the truth and to do everything for its sake.",ancient
plato,-350,"our love for every kind of knowledge has made us let them all in together, before any of the pleasures.",ancient
plato,-350,"for pleasure is the greatest impostor of all, by general account, and in connection with the pleasures of love, which seem to be the greatest of all, even perjury is pardoned by the gods.",ancient
plato,-350,"now, many people accept their testimony, as the seers do that of the birds, and judge that pleasures are most effective in securing the happy life; they even believe that the animal passions are more authoritative witnesses than is the love of argument that is constantly revealed under the guidance of the philosophic muse.",ancient
plato,-350,"to gratify phaedrus (the passionate admirer of speeches and rhetoric in the dialogue named after him), who indignantly regrets the neglect by greek poets and writers of the god of love, the company agree to give speeches in turn, while they all drink, in praise of love. '",ancient
plato,-350,"love' (greek ero?s) covers sexual attraction and gratification between men and women and between men and teenage boys, but the focus here is also and especially on the adult male's role as ethical and intellectual educator of the adolescent that was traditional among the athenians in the latter sort of relationship, whether accompanied by sex or not.",ancient
plato,-350,"in his youth alcibiades had been one of socrates' admiring followers, and he now reports in gripping detail the fascinating reversal socrates worked upon him in the erotic roles of the older and the younger man usual among the greeks in a relationship of 'love':",ancient
plato,-350,": as he enters callias' house, socrates spots four of the speakers phaedrus and eryximachus in a crowd round hippias, and agathon and pausanias (his lover) hanging on the words of prodicus; alcibiades joins the company shortly afterwards.",ancient
plato,-350,socrates' own speech is given over to reporting a discourse on love,ancient
plato,-350,"in any event, diotima herself is made to say that socrates can probably not follow her in the 'final and highest mystery' of the 'rites of love' her account of the ascent in love, beginning with love for individual young men, ending with love for the form of beauty, which 'always is and neither comes to be nor passes away, neither waxes nor wanes', and is 'not beautiful this way and ugly that way, nor beautiful at one time and ugly at another, nor beautiful in relation to one thing and ugly in relation to another' but is 'just what it is to be beautiful'.",ancient
plato,-350,"readers will want to compare diotima's speech on love with those of socrates in phaedrus, and also with socrates' discussion on friendship with the boys in the lysis.",ancient
plato,-350,"'you know there once was a gathering at agathon's when socrates, alcibiades, and their friends had dinner together; i wanted to ask you about the speeches they made on love.",ancient
plato,-350,"our poets have composed hymns in honor of just about any god you can think of; but has a single one of them given one moment's thought to the god of love, ancient and powerful as he is?",ancient
plato,-350,"how could people pay attention to such trifles and never, not even once, write a proper hymn to love?",ancient
plato,-350,"if you agree, we can spend the whole evening in discussion, because i propose that each of us give as good a speech in praise of love as he is capable of giving, in proper order from left to right.",ancient
plato,-350,"how could i vote 'no,' when the only thing i say i understand is the art of love?",ancient
plato,-350,"so let phaedrus begin, with the blessing of fortune; let's hear his praise of love.'",ancient
plato,-350,"love is a great god, wonderful in many ways to gods and men, and",ancient
plato,-350,"we honor him as one of the most ancient gods, and the proof of his great age is this: the parents of love have no place in poetry or legend.",ancient
plato,-350,"but then came earth, broad chested, a seat for all, forever safe, and love.",ancient
plato,-350,"and acusilaus agrees with hesiod: after chaos came earth and love, these two.",ancient
plato,-350,and parmenides tells of this beginning: the very first god she designed was love.,ancient
plato,-350,"all sides agree, then, that love is one of the most ancient gods.",ancient
plato,-350,"i cannot say what greater good there is for a young boy than a gentle lover, or for a lover than a boy to love.",ancient
plato,-350,nothing imparts this guidance as well as love.,ancient
plato,-350,"what i say is this: if a man in love is found doing something shameful, or accepting shameful treatment because he is a coward and makes no defense, then nothing would give him more pain than being seen by the boy he loves not even being seen by his father or his comrades.",ancient
plato,-350,"the same thing also in the boy he loves, that he is especially ashamed before his lover when he is caught in something shameful.",ancient
plato,-350,if only there were a way to start a city or an army made up of lovers and the boys they love!,ancient
plato,-350,"for a man in love would never allow his loved one, of all people, to see him leaving ranks or dropping weapons.",ancient
plato,-350,"and as for leaving the boy behind, or not coming to his aid in danger why, no one is so base that true love could not inspire him with courage, and make him as brave as if he'd been born a hero.",ancient
plato,-350,"when homer says a god 'breathes might' into some of the heroes, this is really love's gift to every lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"besides, no one will die for you but a lover, and a lover will do this even if she's a woman.",ancient
plato,-350,"because of her love, she went so far beyond his parents in family feeling that she made them look like outsiders, as if they belonged to their son in name only.",ancient
plato,-350,"as you can see, the eager courage of love wins highest honors from the gods.",ancient
plato,-350,"they did not give him the woman herself, because they thought he was soft (he was, after all, a cithara player) and did not dare to die like alcestis for love's sake, but contrived to enter living into hades.",ancient
plato,-350,"they sent him to the isles of the blest because he dared to stand by his lover patroclus and avenge him, even after he had learned from his mother that he would die if he killed hector, but that if he chose otherwise he'd go home and end his life as an old man.",ancient
plato,-350,"the gods were highly delighted at this, of course, and gave him special honor, because he made so much of his lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"achilles was the lover; he was more beautiful than patroclus, more beautiful than all the heroes, and still beardless.",ancient
plato,-350,"in truth, the gods honor virtue most highly when it belongs to love.",ancient
plato,-350,"they are more impressed and delighted, however, and are more generous with a loved one who cherishes his lover, than with a lover who cherishes the boy he loves.",ancient
plato,-350,"a lover is more godlike than his boy, you see, since he is inspired by a god.",ancient
plato,-350,"therefore i say love is the most ancient of the gods, the most honored, and the most powerful in helping men gain virtue and blessedness, whether they are alive or have passed away.",ancient
plato,-350,our charge has been simple to speak in praise of love.,ancient
plato,-350,"this would have been fine if love himself were simple, too, but as a matter of fact, there are two kinds of love.",ancient
plato,-350,"in view of this, it might be better to begin by making clear which kind of love we are to praise.",ancient
plato,-350,let me therefore try to put our discussion back on the right track and explain which kind of love ought to be praised.,ancient
plato,-350,it is a well known fact that love and aphrodite are inseparable.,ancient
plato,-350,"if, therefore, aphrodite were a single goddess, there could also be a single love; but, since there are actually two goddesses of that name, there also are two kinds of love.",ancient
plato,-350,"it follows, therefore, that there is a common as well as a heavenly love, depending on which goddess is love's partner.",ancient
plato,-350,and my point is that exactly this principle applies to being in love:,ancient
plato,-350,love is not in himself noble and worthy of.,ancient
plato,-350,now the common aphrodite's love is himself truly common.,ancient
plato,-350,"this, of course, is the love felt by the vulgar, who are attached to women no less than to boys, to the body more than to the soul, and to the least intelligent partners, since all they care about is completing the sexual act.",ancient
plato,-350,"for the love who moves them belongs to a much younger goddess, who, through her parentage, partakes of the nature both of the female and the male.",ancient
plato,-350,contrast this with the love of heavenly aphrodite.,ancient
plato,-350,"this goddess, whose descent is purely male (hence this love is for boys), is considerably older and therefore free from the lewdness of youth.",ancient
plato,-350,that's why those who are inspired by her love are attracted to the male: they find pleasure in what is by nature stronger and more intelligent.,ancient
plato,-350,"but, even within the group that is attracted to handsome boys, some are not moved purely by this heavenly love; those who are do not fall in love with little boys; they prefer older ones whose cheeks are showing the first traces of a beard a sign that they have begun to form minds of their own.",ancient
plato,-350,"i am convinced that a man who falls in love with a young man of this age is generally prepared to share everything with the one he loves he is eager, in fact, to spend the rest of his own life with him.",ancient
plato,-350,"good men, of course, are willing to make a law like this for themselves, but those other lovers, the vulgar ones, need external restraint.",ancient
plato,-350,these vulgar lovers are the people who have given love such a bad reputation that some have gone so far as to claim that taking any man as a lover is in itself disgraceful.,ancient
plato,-350,"would anyone make this claim if he weren't thinking of how hasty vulgar lovers are, and therefore how unfair to their loved ones?",ancient
plato,-350,"i should point out, however, that, although the customs regarding love in most cities are simple and easy to understand, here in athens (and in sparta as well) they are remarkably complex.",ancient
plato,-350,"in places where the people are inarticulate, like elis or boeotia, tradition straightforwardly approves taking a lover in every case.",ancient
plato,-350,"by contrast, in places like ionia and almost every other part of the persian empire, taking a lover is always considered disgraceful.",ancient
plato,-350,the persian empire is absolute; that is why it condemns love as well as philosophy and sport.,ancient
plato,-350,"that these are precisely the effects of philosophy, sport, and especially of love is a lesson the tyrants of athens learned directly from their own experience: didn't their reign come to a dismal end because of the bonds uniting harmodius and aristogiton in love and affection?",ancient
plato,-350,"so you can see that plain condemnation of love reveals lust for power in the rulers and cowardice in the ruled, while indiscriminate approval testifies to general dullness and stupidity.",ancient
plato,-350,"recall, for example, that we consider it more honorable to declare your love rather than to keep it a secret, especially if you are in love with a youth of good family and accomplishment, even if he isn't all that beautiful.",ancient
plato,-350,recall also that a lover is encouraged in every possible way,ancient
plato,-350,"and as for attempts at conquest, our custom is to praise lovers for totally extraordinary acts so extraordinary, in fact, that if they performed them for any other purpose whatever, they would reap the most profound contempt suppose, for example, that in order to secure money, or a public post, or any other practical benefit from another person, a man were willing to do what lovers do for the ones they love.",ancient
plato,-350,"but let a lover act in any of these ways, and everyone will immediately say what a charming man he is!",ancient
plato,-350,"and what is even more remarkable is that, at least according to popular wisdom, the gods will forgive a lover even for breaking his vows a lover's vow",ancient
plato,-350,the freedom given to the lover by both gods and men according to our custom is immense.,ancient
plato,-350,"in view of all this, you might well conclude that in our city we consider the lover's desire and the willingness to satisfy it as the noblest things in.",ancient
plato,-350,"although their attempt failed, the tyranny fell three years later, and the lovers were celebrated as tyrannicides.",ancient
plato,-350,"as i said earlier, love is, like everything else, complex: considered simply in itself, it is neither honorable nor a disgrace",ancient
plato,-350,"i'll tell you: it is the common, vulgar lover, who loves the body rather than the soul,",ancient
plato,-350,"the man whose love is bound to be inconstant, since what he loves is itself mutable and unstable.",ancient
plato,-350,"how different from this is a man who loves the right sort of character, and who remains its lover for life, attached as he is to something that is permanent.",ancient
plato,-350,"we can now see the point of our customs: they are designed to separate the wheat from the chaff, the proper love from the vile.",ancient
plato,-350,"that's why we do everything we can to make it as easy as possible for lovers to press their suits and as difficult as possible for young men to comply; it is like a competition, a kind of test to determine to which sort each belongs.",ancient
plato,-350,"our customs, then, provide for only one honorable way of taking a man as a lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"in addition to recognizing that the lover's total and willing subjugation to his beloved's wishes is neither servile nor reprehensible, we allow that there is one and only one further reason for willingly subjecting oneself to another which is equally above reproach: that is subjection for the sake of virtue.",ancient
plato,-350,"both these principles that is, both the principle governing the proper attitude toward the lover.",ancient
plato,-350,of young men and the principle governing the love of wisdom and of virtue in general must be combined if a young man is to accept a lover in an honorable way.,ancient
plato,-350,"when an older lover and a young man come together and each obeys the principle appropriate to him when the lover realizes that he is justified in doing anything for a loved one who grants him favors, and when the young man understands that he is justified in performing any service for a lover who can make him wise and virtuous and when the lover is able to help the young man become wiser and better, and the young man is eager to be taught and improved by his lover then, and only then, when these two principles coincide absolutely, is it ever honorable for a young man to accept a lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"suppose, for example, that someone thinks his lover is rich and accepts him for his money; his action won't be any less shameful if it turns out that he was deceived and his lover was a poor man after all.",ancient
plato,-350,"by the same token, suppose that someone takes a lover in the mistaken belief that this lover is a good man and likely to make him better himself, while in reality the man is horrible, totally lacking in virtue; even so, it is noble for him to have been deceived.",ancient
plato,-350,"it follows, therefore, that giving in to your lover for virtue's sake is honorable, whatever the outcome.",ancient
plato,-350,"and this, of course, is the heavenly love of the heavenly goddess.",ancient
plato,-350,"love's value to the city as a whole and to the citizens is immeasurable, for he compels the lover and his loved one alike to make virtue their central concern.",ancient
plato,-350,all other forms of love belong to the vulgar goddess.,ancient
plato,-350,"phaedrus, i'm afraid this hasty improvisation will have to do as my contribution on the subject of love.",ancient
plato,-350,his distinction between the two species of love seems to me very useful indeed.,ancient
plato,-350,"but if i have learned a single lesson from my own field, the science of medicine, it is that love does not occur only in the human soul; it is not simply the attraction we feel toward human beauty: it is a significantly broader phenomenon.",ancient
plato,-350,"love is a deity of the greatest importance: he directs everything that occurs, not only in the humandomain, but also in that of the gods.",ancient
plato,-350,the point is that our very bodies manifest the two species of love.,ancient
plato,-350,"consider for a moment the marked difference, the radical dissimilarity, between healthy and diseased constitutions and the fact that dissimilar subjects desire and love objects that are themselves dissimilar.",ancient
plato,-350,"therefore, the love manifested in health is fundamentally distinct from the love manifested in disease.",ancient
plato,-350,"in short, medicine is simply the science of the effects of love on repletion and depletion of the body, and the hallmark of the accomplished physician is his ability to distinguish the love that is noble from the love that is ugly and disgraceful.",ancient
plato,-350,a good practitioner knows how to affect the body and how to transform its desires; he can implant the proper species of love when it is absent and eliminate the other sort whenever it occurs.,ancient
plato,-350,the physician's task is to effect a reconciliation and establish mutual love between the most basic bodily elements.,ancient
plato,-350,"in fact, our ancestor asclepius first established medicine as a profession when he learned how to produce concord and love between such opposites that is what those poet fellows say, and this time i concur with them.",ancient
plato,-350,"medicine, therefore, is guided everywhere by the god of love, and so are physical education and farming as well.",ancient
plato,-350,"music, like medicine, creates agreement by producing concord and love between these various opposites.",ancient
plato,-350,music is therefore simply the science of the effects of love on rhythm and harmony.,ancient
plato,-350,these effects are easily discernible if you consider the constitution of rhythm and harmony in themselves; love does not occur in both his forms in thisdomain.,ancient
plato,-350,"ultimately, the identical argument applies once again: the love felt by good people or by those whom such love might improve in this regard must be encouraged and protected.",ancient
plato,-350,"this is the honorable, heavenly species of love, produced by the melodies of urania, the heavenly muse.",ancient
plato,-350,"in music, therefore, as well as in medicine and in all the otherdomains, in matters divine as well as in human affairs, we must attend with the greatest possible care to these two species of love, which are, indeed, to be found everywhere.",ancient
plato,-350,"when the elements to which i have already referred hot and cold, wet and dry are animated by the proper species of love, they are in harmony with one another: their mixture is temperate, and so is the climate.",ancient
plato,-350,"but when the sort of love that is crude and impulsive controls the seasons, he brings death and destruction.",ancient
plato,-350,"all these are the effects of the immodest and disordered species of love on the movements of the stars and the seasons of the year, that is, on the objects studied by the science called astronomy.",ancient
plato,-350,"here, too, love is the central concern: our object is to try to maintain the proper kind of love and to attempt to cure the kind that is diseased.",ancient
plato,-350,"our refusal to gratify the orderly kind of love, and our deference to the other sort, when we should have been guided by the former sort of love in every action in connection with our parents, living or dead, and with the gods.",ancient
plato,-350,the task of divination is to keep watch over these two species of love and to doctor them as necessary.,ancient
plato,-350,"divination, therefore, is the practice that produces loving affection between gods and men; it is simply the science of the effects of love on justice and piety.",ancient
plato,-350,such is the power of love so varied and great that in all cases it might be called absolute.,ancient
plato,-350,"yet even so it is far greater when love is directed, in temperance and justice, toward the good, whether in heaven or on earth: happiness and good fortune, the bonds of human society, concord with the gods above all these are among his gifts.",ancient
plato,-350,"perhaps i, too, have omitted a great deal in this discourse on love.",ancient
plato,-350,"makes me wonder whether the 'orderly sort of love' in the body calls for the sounds and itchings that constitute a sneeze, because the hiccups stopped immediately when i applied the sneeze treatment.'",ancient
plato,-350,"you see, i think people have entirely missed the power of love, because, if they had grasped it, they'd have built the greatest temples and altars to him and made the greatest sacrifices.",ancient
plato,-350,"for he loves the human race more than any other god, he stands by us in our troubles, and he cures those ills",ancient
plato,-350,"this, then, is the source of our desire to love each other.",ancient
plato,-350,love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature.,ancient
plato,-350,"while they are boys, because they are chips off the male block, they love men and enjoy lying with men and being embraced by men; those are the best of boys and lads, because they are the most manly in their nature.",ancient
plato,-350,"when they're grown men, they are lovers of young men, and they naturally pay no attention to marriage or to making babies, except insofar as they are required by local custom.",ancient
plato,-350,"in every way, then, this sort of man grows up as a lover of young men and a lover of love, always rejoicing in his own kind.",ancient
plato,-350,": the two are struck from their senses by love, by a sense of belonging to one another, and by desire, and they don't want to be separated from one another, not even for a moment.",ancient
plato,-350,no one would think it is the intimacy of sex that mere sex is the reason each lover takes so great and deep a joy in being with the other.,ancient
plato,-350,"it's obvious that the soul of every lover longs for something else; his soul cannot say what it is, but like an oracle it has a sense of what it wants, and like an oracle it hides behind a riddle.",ancient
plato,-350,"suppose two lovers are lying together and hephaest stands over them with his mending tools, asking, 'what is it you human beings really want from each other?'",ancient
plato,-350,"look at your love, and see if this is what you desire",ancient
plato,-350,"instead, everyone would think he'd found out at last what he had always wanted: to come together and melt together with the one he loves, so that one person.",ancient
plato,-350,"it's because, as i said, we used to be complete wholes in our original nature, and now 'love' is the name for our pursuit of wholeness, for our desire to be complete.",ancient
plato,-350,"and we will, if love is our guide and our commander.",ancient
plato,-350,"whoever opposes love is hateful to the gods, but if we become friends of the god and cease to quarrel with him, then we shall find the young men that are meant for us and win their love, as very few men do nowadays.",ancient
plato,-350,": we must bring love to its perfect conclusion, and each of us must win the favors of his very own young man, so that he can recover his original nature.",ancient
plato,-350,"if we are to give due praise to the god who can give us this blessing, then, we must praise love.",ancient
plato,-350,love does the best that can be done for the time being: he draws us towards what belongs to us.,ancient
plato,-350,"but for the future, love promises the greatest hope of all: if we treat the gods with due reverence, he will restore to us our original nature, and by healing us, he will make us blessed and happy. '",ancient
plato,-350,"that,' he said, 'is my speech about love, eryximachus.",ancient
plato,-350,"really, we've had such a rich feast of speeches on love, that if i couldn't vouch for the fact that socrates and agathon are masters of the art of love, i'd be afraid that they'd have nothing left to say.",ancient
plato,-350,"now, like you, i enjoy listening to socrates in discussion, but it is my duty to see to the praising of love and to exact a speech from every one of this group.",ancient
plato,-350,"so now, in the case of love, it is right for us to praise him first for what he is and afterwards for his gifts.",ancient
plato,-350,"i maintain, then, that while all the gods are happy, love if i may say so without giving offense is the happiest of them all, for he is the most beautiful and the best.",ancient
plato,-350,love was born to hate old age and will come nowhere near it.,ancient
plato,-350,love always lives with young people and is one of them: the old story holds good that like is always drawn to like.,ancient
plato,-350,"and though on many other points i agree with phaedrus, i do not agree with this: that love is more ancient than cronus and iapetus.",ancient
plato,-350,"those old stories hesiod and parmenides tell about the gods those things happened under necessity, not love, if what they say is true.",ancient
plato,-350,"for not one of all those violent deeds would have been done no castrations, no imprisonments if love had been present among them.",ancient
plato,-350,"there would have been peace and brotherhood instead, as there has been now as long as love has been king of the gods.",ancient
plato,-350,"a lovely proof, i think, to show how delicate she is: she doesn't walk on anything hard; she walks only on what is soft.",ancient
plato,-350,"we shall use the same proof about love, then, to show that he is delicate.",ancient
plato,-350,"everyone knows that love has extraordinary good looks, and between ugliness and love there is unceasing war.",ancient
plato,-350,"after this, we should speak of love's moral character.",ancient
plato,-350,"the main point is that love is neither the cause nor the victim of any injustice; he does no wrong to gods or men, nor they to him.",ancient
plato,-350,"if anything has an effect on him, it is never by violence, for violence never touches love.",ancient
plato,-350,"and the effects he has on others are not forced, for every service we give to love we give willingly.",ancient
plato,-350,"for moderation, by common agreement, is power over pleasures and passions, and no pleasure is more powerful than love!",ancient
plato,-350,"but if they are weaker, they are under the power of love, and he has the power; and because he has power over pleasures and passions, love is exceptionally moderate.",ancient
plato,-350,"and as for manly bravery, 'not even ares can stand up to' love!",ancient
plato,-350,"for ares has no hold on love, but love does on ares love of aphrodite, so runs the tale.",ancient
plato,-350,"but he who has hold is more powerful than he who is held; and so, because love has power over the bravest of the others, he is bravest of them all.",ancient
plato,-350,"in the first place to honor our profession as eryximachus did the god is so skilled a poet that he can make others into poets: once love touches him, anyone becomes a poet,. .",ancient
plato,-350,"this, we may fittingly observe, testifies that love is a good poet, good, in sum, at every kind of artistic production.",ancient
plato,-350,and as to the production of animals who will deny that they are all born and begotten through love's skill?,ancient
plato,-350,"and as for artisans and professionals don't we know that whoever has this god for a teacher ends up in the light of fame, while a man untouched by love ends in obscurity?",ancient
plato,-350,"apollo, for one, invented archery, medicine, and prophecy when desire and love showed the way.",ancient
plato,-350,"even he, therefore, would be a pupil of love, and so would the muses in music, hephaestus in bronze work, athena in weaving, and zeus in 'the governance of gods and men.'",ancient
plato,-350,"that too is how the gods' quarrels were settled, once love came to be among them love of beauty, obviously, because love is not drawn to ugliness.",ancient
plato,-350,"but once this god was born, all goods came to gods and men alike through love of beauty.",ancient
plato,-350,"this is how i think of love, phaedrus: first, he is himself the most beautiful and the best; after that, if anyone else is at all like that, love is responsible.",ancient
plato,-350,love fills us with togetherness and drains all of our divisiveness away.,ancient
plato,-350,love calls gatherings like these together.,ancient
plato,-350,"love moves us to mildness, removes from us wildness.",ancient
plato,-350,"treasure to lovers, envy to others, father of elegance, luxury, delicacy, grace, yearning, desire.",ancient
plato,-350,"love cares well for good men, cares not for bad ones.",ancient
plato,-350,"in pain, in fear, in desire, or speech, love is our best guide and guard; he is our comrade and our savior.",ancient
plato,-350,"every man should follow love, sing beautifully his hymns, and join with him in the song he sings that charms the mind of god or man.",ancient
plato,-350,"then i realized how ridiculous i'd been to agree to join with you in praising love and to say that i was a master of the art of love, when i knew nothing",ancient
plato,-350,"and if they are false, that is no objection; for the proposal, apparently, was that everyone here make the rest of us think he is praising love and not that he actually praise him.",ancient
plato,-350,i think that is why you stir up every word and apply it to love; your description of him and his gifts is designed to make him look better and more beautiful than anything else to ignorant listeners,ancient
plato,-350,"you will hear the truth about love, and the words and phrasing will take care of themselves.'",ancient
plato,-350,"indeed, agathon, my friend, i thought you led the way beautifully into your speech when you said that one should first show the qualities of love himself, and",ancient
plato,-350,"come, then, since you have beautifully and magnificently expounded his qualities in other ways, tell me this, too, about love.",ancient
plato,-350,is love such as to be a love of something or of nothing?,ancient
plato,-350,"i'm not asking if he is born of some mother or father, (for the question whether love is love of mother or of father would really be ridiculous), but it's as if i'm asking this about a father whether a father is the father of something or not.",ancient
plato,-350,"now try to tell me about love,' he said. '",ancient
plato,-350,is love the love of nothing or of something?' ',ancient
plato,-350,"then keep this object of love in mind, and remember what it is.",ancient
plato,-350,"does love desire that of which it is the love, or not?' '",ancient
plato,-350,"at the time he desires and loves something, does he actually have what he desires and loves at that time, or doesn't he?' '",ancient
plato,-350,"so socrates said, 'then this is what it is to love something which is not at hand, which the lover does not have: it is to desire the preservation of what he now has in time to come, so that he will have it then.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"so such a man or anyone else who has a desire desires what is not at hand and not present, what he does not have, and what he is not, and that of which he is in need; for such are the objects of desire and love.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"aren't they, first, that love is the love of something, and, second, that he loves things of which he has a present need?' '",ancient
plato,-350,"now, remember, in addition to these points, what you said in your speech about what it is that love loves.",ancient
plato,-350,"i think you said something like this: that the gods' quarrels were settled by love of beautiful things, for there is no love of ugly ones.",ancient
plato,-350,"but if this is so, wouldn't love have to be a desire for beauty, and never for ugliness?'",ancient
plato,-350,and we also agreed that he loves just what he needs and does not have.',ancient
plato,-350,"so love needs beauty, then, and does not have it.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"then do you still agree that love is beautiful, if those things are so?'",ancient
plato,-350,"then if love needs beautiful things, and if all good things are beautiful, he will need good things too.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"then it's the truth, my beloved agathon, that you are unable to contradict,' he said.",ancient
plato,-350,the speech about love,ancient
plato,-350,"she is the one who taught me the art of love, and i shall go through her speech as best i can on my own, using what agathon and i have agreed to as a basis.",ancient
plato,-350,"following your lead, agathon, one should first describe who love is and what he is like, and afterwards describe his works i think it will be easiest for me to proceed the way diotima did and tell you how she questioned me.",ancient
plato,-350,"you see, i had told her almost the same things agathon told me just now: that love is a great god and that he belongs to beautiful things.",ancient
plato,-350,"and she used the very same arguments against me that i used against agathon; she showed how, according to my very own speech, love is neither beautiful nor good.",ancient
plato,-350,"is love ugly, then, and bad?'",ancient
plato,-350,the greek is ambiguous between 'love loves beautiful things' and 'love is one of the beautiful things.',ancient
plato,-350,it's the same with love:,ancient
plato,-350,you don't believe love is a god either!' ',ancient
plato,-350,"then, what could love be?'",ancient
plato,-350,"these spirits are many and various, then, and one of them is love.'",ancient
plato,-350,so she lay beside him and got pregnant with love.,ancient
plato,-350,that is why love was born to follow aphrodite and serve her: because he was conceived on the day of her birth.,ancient
plato,-350,"and that's why he is also by nature a lover of beauty, because aphrodite herself is especially beautiful. '",ancient
plato,-350,"but on his father's side he is a schemer after the beautiful and the good; he is brave, impetuous, and intense, an awesome hunter, always weaving snares, resourceful in his pursuit of intelligence, a lover of wisd through all his life, a genius with enchantments, potions, and clever pleadings. '",ancient
plato,-350,"because he is his father's son, however, he keeps coming back to life, but then anything he finds his way to always slips away, and for this reason love is never completely without resources, nor is he ever rich. '",ancient
plato,-350,"in fact, you see, none of the gods loves wisdom or wants to become wise for they are wise and no one else who is wise already loves wisdom; on the other hand, no.",ancient
plato,-350,one who is ignorant will love wisdom either or want to become wise.,ancient
plato,-350,"in that case, diotima, who are the people who love wisdom, if they are neither wise nor ignorant?' '",ancient
plato,-350,those who love wisdom fall in between those two extremes.,ancient
plato,-350,"and love is one of them, because he is in love with what is beautiful, and wisdom is extremely beautiful.",ancient
plato,-350,"it follows that love must be a lover of wisdom and, as such, is in between being wise and being ignorant.",ancient
plato,-350,"my dear socrates, that, then, is the nature of the spirit called love.",ancient
plato,-350,"considering what you thought about love, it's no surprise that you were led into thinking of love as you did.",ancient
plato,-350,"on the basis of what you say, i conclude that you thought love was being loved, rather than being a lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"i think that's why love struck you as beautiful in every way: because it is what is really beautiful and graceful that deserves to be loved, and this is perfect and highly blessed; but being a lover takes a different form, which i have just described.'",ancient
plato,-350,"what you say about love is beautiful, but if you're right, what use is love to human beings?'",ancient
plato,-350,so far i've been explaining the character and the parentage of love.,ancient
plato,-350,"now, according to you, he is love for beautiful things.",ancient
plato,-350,it's clearer this way: 'the lover of beautiful things has a desire; what does he desire?' ',ancient
plato,-350,"then she said, 'suppose someone changes the question, putting 'good' in place of 'beautiful,' and asks you this: 'tell me, socrates, a lover of good things has a desire; what does he desire?' '",ancient
plato,-350,"now this desire for happiness, this kind of love do you think it is common to all human beings and that everyone wants to have good things forever and ever?",ancient
plato,-350,"then, socrates, why don't we say that everyone is in love,' she asked, 'since everyone always loves the same things?",ancient
plato,-350,"instead, we say some people are in love and others not; why is that?' '",ancient
plato,-350,"'it's because we divide out a special kind of love, and we refer to it by the word that means the whole 'love'; and for the other kinds of love we use other words.' '",ancient
plato,-350,that's also how it is with love.,ancient
plato,-350,the main point is this: every desire for good things or for happiness is 'the supreme and treacherous love' in everyone.,ancient
plato,-350,"but those who pursue this along any of its many other ways through making money, or through the love of sports, or through philosophy we don't say that these people are in love, and we don't call them lovers.",ancient
plato,-350,it's only when people are devoted exclusively to one special kind of love that we use these words that really belong to the whole of it: 'love' and 'in love' and 'lovers.',ancient
plato,-350,"now there is a certain story,' she said, 'according to which lovers are those people who seek their other halves.",ancient
plato,-350,"but according to my story, a lover does not seek the half or the whole, unless, my friend, it turns out to be good as well.",ancient
plato,-350,that's because what everyone loves is really nothing other than the good.,ancient
plato,-350,can we simply say that people love the good?' ',ancient
plato,-350,"in a word, then, love is wanting to possess the good forever.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"'this, then, is the object of love,' she said. '",ancient
plato,-350,"now, how do lovers pursue it?",ancient
plato,-350,we'd rightly say that when they are in love they do something with eagerness and zeal.,ancient
plato,-350,diotima may mean that the lover causes the newborn (which may be an idea) to come to be within a beautiful person; or she may mean that he is stimulated to give birth to it in the presence of a beautiful person.,ancient
plato,-350,"you see, socrates,' she said, 'what love wants is not beauty, as you think it is.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"a lover must desire immortality along with the good, if what we agreed earlier was right, that love wants to possess the good forever.",ancient
plato,-350,it follows from our argument that love must desire immortality.',ancient
plato,-350,"all this she taught me, on those occasions when she spoke on the art of love.",ancient
plato,-350,"and once she asked, 'what do you think causes love and desire, socrates?",ancient
plato,-350,"footed and winged animals alike, all are plagued by the disease of love.",ancient
plato,-350,"human beings, you'd think, would do this because they understand the reason for it; but what causes wild animals to be in such a state of love?",ancient
plato,-350,"so she said, 'how do you think you'll ever master the art of love, if you don't know that?' '",ancient
plato,-350,"so tell me what causes this, and everything else that belongs to the art of love.'",ancient
plato,-350,"if you really believe that love by its nature aims at what we have often agreed it does, then don't be surprised at the answer,' she said. '",ancient
plato,-350,"so don't be surprised if everything naturally values its own offspring, because it is for the sake of immortality that everything shows this zeal, which is love.'",ancient
plato,-350,"you'd be amazed at their irrationality, if you didn't have in mind what i spoke about and if you hadn't pondered the awful state of love they're in, wanting to become famous and 'to lay up glory immortal forever,' and how they're ready to brave any danger for the sake of this, much more than they are for their children; and they are prepared to spend money, suffer through all sorts of ordeals, and even die for the sake of glory.",ancient
plato,-350,"'i believe that anyone will do anything for the sake of immortal virtue and the glorious fame that follows; and the better the people, the more they will do, for they are all in love with immortality. '",ancient
plato,-350,"now, some people are pregnant in body, and for this reason turn more to women and pursue love in that way, providing themselves through childbirth with immortality and remembrance and happiness, as they think, for all time to come; while others are pregnant in soul because there surely are those who are even more pregnant in their souls than in their bodies, and these are pregnant with what is fitting for a soul to bear and bring to birth.",ancient
plato,-350,"even you, socrates, could probably come to be initiated into these rites of love.",ancient
plato,-350,a lover who goes about this matter correctly must begin in his youth to devote himself to beautiful bodies.,ancient
plato,-350,"first, if the lead leads aright, he should love one body and beget beautiful ideas there; then he should realize that the beauty of any one body is brother to the beauty of any other and that if he is to pursue beauty of form he'd be very foolish not to think that the beauty of all bodies is one and the same.",ancient
plato,-350,"when he grasps this, he must become a lover of all beautiful bodies, and he must think that this wild gaping after just one body is a small thing and despise it. '",ancient
plato,-350,"after this he must think that the beauty of people's souls is more valuable than the beauty of their bodies, so that if someone is decent in his soul, even though he is scarcely blooming in his body, our lover must be content to love and care for him and to seek to give birth to such ideas.",ancient
plato,-350,"the result is that our lover will be forced to gaze at the beauty of activities and laws and to see that all this is akin to itself, with the result that he will think that the beauty of bodies is a thing of no importance.",ancient
plato,-350,"the result is that he will see the beauty of knowledge and be looking mainly not at beauty in a single example as a servant would who favored the beauty of a little boy or a man or a single custom (being a slave, of course, he's low and small minded) but the lover is turned to the great sea of beauty, and, gazing upon this, he gives birth to many gloriously beautiful ideas and theories, in unstinting love of wisdom, until, having grown and been strengthened there, he catches sight of such knowledge, and it is the knowledge of such beauty. . '",ancient
plato,-350,"you see, the man who has been thus far guided in matters of love, who has beheld beautiful things in the right order and correctly, is coming now to the goal of loving: all of a sudden",ancient
plato,-350,"this is what it is to go aright, or be led by another, into the mystery of love: one goes always upwards for the sake of this beauty, starting out from beautiful things and using them like rising stairs: from one body to two and from two to all beautiful bodies, then from beautiful bodies to beautiful customs, and from customs to learning beautiful things, and from these lessons he arriv in the end at this lesson, which is learning of this very beauty, so that in the end he comes to know just what it is to be beautiful. '",ancient
plato,-350,"you out of your senses, and make you, you and many others, eager to be with the boys you love and look at them forever, if there were any way to do that, forgetting food and drink, everything but looking at them and being with them.",ancient
plato,-350,"the love of the gods belongs to anyone who has given birth to true virtue and nourished it, and if any human being could become immortal, it would be he.'",ancient
plato,-350,"and once persuaded, i try to persuade others too that human nature can find no better workmate for acquiring this than love.",ancient
plato,-350,"that's why i say that every man must honor love, why i honor the rites of love myself and practice them with special diligence, and why i commend them to others.",ancient
plato,-350,now and always i praise the power and courage of love so far as i am able.,ancient
plato,-350,"consider this speech, then, phaedrus, if you wish, a speech in praise of love.",ancient
plato,-350,"you can't imagine what it's like to be in love with him: from the very first moment he realized how i felt about him, he hasn't allowed me to say two words to anybody else",ancient
plato,-350,earlier this evening we decided to use this occasion to offer a series of encomia of love.,ancient
plato,-350,olympus was a legendary musician who was said to be loved by marsyas (minos and to have made music that moved its listeners out of their senses.,ancient
plato,-350,"my idea, naturally, was that he'd take advantage of the opportunity to tell me whatever it is that lovers say when they find themselves alone; i relished the moment.",ancient
plato,-350,"so what i did was to invite him to dinner, as if i were his lover and",ancient
plato,-350,"'i think,' i said, 'you're the only worthy lover i have ever had and yet, look how shy you are with me!",ancient
plato,-350,"with a man like you, in fact, i'd be much more ashamed of what wise people would say if i did not take you as my lover, than i would of what all the others, in their foolishness, would say if i did.'",ancient
plato,-350,"he has deceived us all: he presents himself as your lover, and, before you know it, you're in love with him yourself!",ancient
plato,-350,"alcibiades' frankness provoked a lot of laughter, especially since it was obvious that he was still in love with socrates, who immediately said to him: 'you're perfectly sober after all, alcibiades.",ancient
plato,-350,"you think that i should be in love with you and no one else,",ancient
plato,-350,"while you, and no one else, should be in love with agathon well, we were not deceived; we've seen through your little satyr play.",ancient
plato,-350,"phaedrus is commonly paired on the one hand with gorgias and on the other with with the former in sharing its principal theme, the nature and limitations of rhetoric, with the latter in containing speeches devoted to the nature and value of erotic love.",ancient
plato,-350,"there he is inspired to employ his knowledge of philosophy in crafting two speeches on the subject of erotic love, to show how paltry is the best effort on the same subject of the best orator in athens, lysias, who knows no philosophy.",ancient
plato,-350,"by rights, phaedrus' passionate admiration for oratory ought therefore to be transformed into an even more passionate love of philosophical knowledge, fine oratory's essential prerequisite.",ancient
plato,-350,socrates' own speeches about erotic love and his dialectical presentation of rhetoric's subservience to philosophy are both aimed at persuading phaedrus to this transformation.,ancient
plato,-350,in his great second speech socrates draws upon the psychological theory of the and the metaphysics of resplendent forms common to that dialogue and several others (notably phaedo and to inspire in phaedrus a love for philosophy.,ancient
plato,-350,"so socrates himself warns us that the 'philosophical theories' embodied in his speech are resemblances only, motivated in fact by his desire to win phaedrus away from an indiscriminate love of rhetoric to a controlled but elevated love of philosophical study.",ancient
plato,-350,"in fact, socrates, you're just the right person to hear the speech that occupied us, since, in a roundabout way, it was about love.",ancient
plato,-350,"it is aimed at seducing a beautiful boy, but the speaker is not in love with him",ancient
plato,-350,this is actually what is so clever and elegant about it: lysias argues that it is better to give your favors to someone who does not love you than to someone who does.,ancient
plato,-350,"but when that lover of speeches asked him to recite it, he played coy and pretended that he did not want to.",ancient
plato,-350,"but, socrates, it really is true that i did not memorize the speech word for word; instead, i will give a careful summary of its general sense, listing all the ways he said the lover differs from the non lover, in the proper order.",ancient
plato,-350,"and if i'm right, you can be sure that, though i love you dearly, i'll never, as long as lysias himself is present, allow you to practice your own speechmaking on me.",ancient
plato,-350,"the stream is lovely, pure and clear: just right for girls to be playing nearby.",ancient
plato,-350,from under the plane tree the loveliest spring runs with very cool water our feet can testify to that.,ancient
plato,-350,"in any case, i don't think i should lose the chance to get what i am asking for, merely because i don't happen to be in love with you. '",ancient
plato,-350,"a man in love will wish he had not done you any favors once his desire dies down, but the time will never come for a man who's not in love to change his mind.",ancient
plato,-350,"besides, a lover keeps his eye on the balance sheet where his interests have suffered from love, and where he has done well; and when he adds up all the trouble he has taken, he thinks he's long since given the boy he loved a fair return.",ancient
plato,-350,"a non lover, on the other hand, can't complain about love's making him neglect his own business; he can't keep a tab on the trouble he's been through, or blame you for the quarrels he's had with his relatives.",ancient
plato,-350,"besides, suppose a lover does deserve to be honored because, as they say, he is the best friend his loved one will ever have, and he stands ready to please his boy with all those words and deeds that are so annoying to everyone else.",ancient
plato,-350,"that the next time he falls in love he will care more for his new love than for the old one, and it's clear he'll treat the old one shabbily whenever that will please the new one. '",ancient
plato,-350,a lover will admit that he's more sick than sound in the head.,ancient
plato,-350,"another point: if you were to choose the best of those who are in love with you, you'd have a pretty small group to pick from; but you'll have a large group if you don't care whether he loves you or not and just pick the one who suits you best; and in that larger pool you'll have a much better hope of finding someone who deserves your friendship. '",ancient
plato,-350,"well, it stands to reason that a lover thinking that everyone else will admire him for his success as much as he admires himself will fly into words and proudly declare to all and sundry that his labors were not in vain.",ancient
plato,-350,"someone who does not love you, on the other hand, can control himself and will choose to do what is best, rather than seek the glory that comes from popular reputation. '",ancient
plato,-350,"besides, it's inevitable that a lover will be found out: many people will see that he devotes his life to following the boy he loves.",ancient
plato,-350,"but they won't even begin to find fault with people for spending time together if they are not lovers; they know one has to talk to someone, either out of friendship or to obtain some other pleasure. '",ancient
plato,-350,"if so, it would make more sense for you to be afraid of lovers.",ancient
plato,-350,"for a lover is easily annoyed, and whatever happens, he'll think it was designed to hurt him.",ancient
plato,-350,that is why a lover prevents the boy he loves from spending time with other people.,ancient
plato,-350,"but if a man really does not love you, if it is only because of his excellence that he got what he asked for, then he won't be jealous of the people who spend time with you.",ancient
plato,-350,"another point: lovers generally start to desire your body before they know your character or have any experience of your other traits, with the result that even they can't tell whether they'll still want to be friends with you after their desire has passed.",ancient
plato,-350,"non lovers, on the other hand, are friends with you even before they achieve their goal, and you've no reason to expect that benefits received will ever detract from their friendship for you.",ancient
plato,-350,"another point: you can expect to become a better person if you are won over by me, rather than by a lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"a lover will praise what you say and what you do far beyond what is best, partly because he is afraid of being disliked, and partly because desire has impaired his judgment.",ancient
plato,-350,"here is how love draws conclusions: when a lover suffers a reverse that would cause no pain to anyone else, love makes him think he's accursed!",ancient

plato,-350,"the result is, you should feel sorry for lovers, not admire them. '",ancient
plato,-350,"if my argument wins you over, i will, first of all, give you my time with no thought of immediate pleasure; i will plan instead for the benefits that are to come, since i am master of myself and have not been overwhelmed by love.",ancient
plato,-350,have you been thinking that there can be no strong friendship in the absence of erotic love?,ancient
plato,-350,"now, remember what i said and keep this in mind: friends often criticize a lover for bad behavior; but no one close to a non lover ever thinks that desire has led him into bad judgment about his interests. '",ancient
plato,-350,and now i suppose you'll ask me whether i'm urging you to give your favors to everyone who is not in love with you.,ancient
plato,-350,"as i see it, a lover would not ask you to give in to all your lovers either.",ancient
plato,-350,i was looking at you while you were reading and it seemed to me the speech had made you radiant with delight; and since i. this is classic behavior in ancient greek literature of a lovesick man pursuing his prey.,ancient
plato,-350,; perhaps it was the lovely sappho or the wise anacreon or even some writer of prose.,ancient
plato,-350,"in our own case, for example, do you think that anyone could argue that one should favor the non lover rather than the lover without praising the former for keeping his wits about him or condemning the latter for losing his points that are essential to make and still have something left to say?",ancient
plato,-350,"i will allow you to presuppose that the lover is less sane than the non lover and if you are able to add anything of value to complete what we already have in hand, you will stand in hammered gold beside the offering of the cypselids in olympia.",ancient
plato,-350,"oh, phaedrus, i was only criticizing your beloved in order to tease you",ancient
plato,-350,you've really found the way to force a lover of speeches to do just as you say!,ancient
plato,-350,": there once was a boy, a youth rather, and he was very beautiful, and had very many lovers.",ancient
plato,-350,"one of them was wily and had persuaded him that he was not in love, though he loved the lad no less than the others.",ancient
plato,-350,"and once in pressing his suit to him, he tried to persuade him that he ought to give his favors to a man who did not love him rather than to one who did.",ancient
plato,-350,"because you and i are about to discuss whether a boy should make friends with a man who loves him rather than with one who does not, we should agree on defining what love is and what effects it has.",ancient
plato,-350,then we can look back and refer to that as we try to find out whether to expect benefit or harm from love.,ancient
plato,-350,"now, as everyone plainly knows, love is some kind of desire; but we also know that even men who are not in love have a desire for what is beautiful.",ancient
plato,-350,so how shall we distinguish between a man who is in love and one who is not?,ancient
plato,-350,what benefit or harm is likely to come from the lover or the non lover to the boy who gives him favors?,ancient
plato,-350,"that is why a lover will not willingly put up with a boyfriend who is his equal or superior, but is always working to make the boy he loves weaker and inferior to himself.",ancient
plato,-350,"by necessity, a lover will be delighted to find all these mental defects and more, whether acquired or innate in his boy; and if he does not, he will have to supply them or else lose the pleasure of the moment.",ancient
plato,-350,"that is, in fact, divine philosophy, from which it is necessary for a lover to keep his boy a great distance away, out of fear the boy will eventually come to look down on him.",ancient
plato,-350,"that way the boy will give his lover the most pleasure, though the harm to himself will be severe.",ancient
plato,-350,so it will not be of any use to your intellectual development to have as your mentor and companion a man who is in love. ',ancient
plato,-350,the sort of body a lover wants in his boy is one that will give confidence to the enemy in a war or other great crisis while causing alarm to friends and even to his lovers.,ancient
plato,-350,our next topic is the benefit or harm to your possessions that will come from a lover's care and company.,ancient
plato,-350,"everyone knows the answer, especially a lover: his first wish will be for a boy who has lost his dearest, kindliest and godliest possessions his mother and father and other close relatives.",ancient
plato,-350,"what is more, a lover would think any money or other wealth the boy owns would only make him harder to snare and, once snared, harder to handle.",ancient
plato,-350,"it follows by absolute necessity that wealth in a boyfriend will cause his lover to envy him, while his poverty will be a delight.",ancient
plato,-350,"but besides being harmful to his boyfriend, a lover is simply disgusting to spend the day with. '",ancient
plato,-350,"besides, as they say, it is miserable for anyone to be forced into anything by necessity and this (to say nothing of the age difference) is most true for a boy with his lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"as for the boy, however, what comfort or pleasure will the lover give to him during all the time they spend together?",ancient
plato,-350,"while he is still in love he is harmful and disgusting, but after his love fades he breaks his trust with you for the future, in spite of all the promises he has made with all those oaths and entreaties which just barely kept you in a relationship that was troublesome at the time, in hope of future benefits.",ancient
plato,-350,"so, then, by the time he should pay up, he has made a change and installed a new ruling government in himself: right minded reason in place of the madness of love.",ancient
plato,-350,the boy does not even realize that his lover is a different man.,ancient
plato,-350,"the lover, however, is so ashamed that he does not dare tell the boy how much he has changed or that there is no way,",ancient
plato,-350,"so now he is a refugee, fleeing from those old promises on which he must default by necessity; he, the former lover, has to switch roles and flee, since the coin has fallen the other way, while the boy must chase after him, angry and cursing.",ancient
plato,-350,all along he has been completely unaware that he should never have given phaedrus his favors to a man who was in love and who therefore had by necessity lost his mind.,ancient
plato,-350,he should much rather have done it for a man who was not in love and had his wits about him.,ancient
plato,-350,you should know that the friendship of a lover arises without any good will at all.,ancient
plato,-350,do wolves love lambs?,ancient
plato,-350,that's how lovers befriend a boy!'',ancient
plato,-350,"i thought you were about to speak at the same length about the non lover, to list his good points and argue that it's better to give one's favors to him.",ancient
plato,-350,"didn't you notice, my friend, that even though i am criticizing the lover, i have passed beyond lyric into epic poetry?",ancient
plato,-350,"so i say instead, in a word, that every shortcoming for which we blamed the lover has its contrary advantage, and the non lover possesses it.",ancient
plato,-350,"simmias, a companion of socrates, was evidently a lover of discussion (cf.",ancient
plato,-350,don't you believe that love is the son of aphrodite?,ancient
plato,-350,but if love is a god or something divine which he is he can't be bad in any way; and yet our speeches just now spoke of him as if he were.,ancient
plato,-350,that is their offense against love.,ancient
plato,-350,"you never sailed that lovely ship, you never reached the tower of troy.",ancient
plato,-350,"now i will prove to be wiser than homer and stesichorus to this small extent: i will try to offer my palinode to love before i am punished for speaking ill of him with my head bare, no longer covered in shame.",ancient
plato,-350,"ibycus was a sixth century poet, most famous for his passionate love poetry.",ancient
plato,-350,"suppose a noble and gentle man, who was (or had once been) in love with a boy of similar character, were to hear us say that lovers start serious quarrels for trivial reasons and that, jealous of their beloved, they do him harm",ancient
plato,-350,"don't you think that man would think we had been brought up among the most vulgar of sailors, totally ignorant of love among the freeborn?",ancient
plato,-350,wouldn't he most certainly refuse to acknowledge the flaws we attributed to love?,ancient
plato,-350,"well, that man makes me feel ashamed, and as i'm also afraid of love himself, i want to wash out the bitterness of what we've heard with a more tasteful speech.",ancient
plato,-350,"and my advice to lysias, too, is to write as soon as possible a speech urging one to give similar favors to a lover rather than to a non lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"for once you have spoken in praise of the lover, i will most definitely make lysias write a speech on the same topic.",ancient
plato,-350,otherwise he may be too quick to give his favors to the non lover.,ancient
plato,-350,"and here is how the speech should go: ''there's no truth to that story' that when a lover is available you should give your favors to a man who doesn't love you instead, because he is in control of himself while the lover has lost his head.",ancient
plato,-350,"besides proving that point, if he is to win his case, our opponent must show that love is not sent by the gods as a benefit to a lover and his boy.",ancient
plato,-350,"at that point, according to the law, the soul is not born into a wild animal in its first incarnation; but a soul that has seen the most will be planted in the seed of a man who will become a lover of wisd or of beauty, or who will be cultivated in the arts and prone to erotic love.",ancient
plato,-350,"the second sort of soul will be put into someone who will be a lawful king or warlike commander; the third, a statesman, a manager of a household, or a financier; the fourth will be a trainer who loves exercise or a doctor who cures the body; the fifth will lead the life of a prophet or priest of the mysteries.",ancient
plato,-350,"in fact, no soul returns to the place from which it came for ten thousand years, since its wings will not grow before then, except for the soul of a man who practices philosophy without guile or who loves boys philosophically.",ancient
plato,-350,"this is the best and noblest of all the forms that possession by god can take for anyone who has it or is connected to it, and when someone who loves beautiful boys is touched by this madness he is called a lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"well, all that was for love of a memory that made me stretch out my speech in longing for the past.",ancient
plato,-350,"it would awaken a terribly powerful love if an image of wisdom came through our sight as clearly as beauty does, and the same goes for the other objects of inspired love.",ancient
plato,-350,"but now beauty alone has this privilege, to be the most clearly visible and the most loved.",ancient
plato,-350,"in its madness the lover's soul cannot sleep at night or stay put by day; it rushes, yearning, wherever it expects to see the person who has that beauty.",ancient
plato,-350,"this is the experience we humans call love, you beautiful boy (i mean the one to whom i am making this speech).",ancient
plato,-350,they praise love this way,ancient
plato,-350,": yes, mortals call him powerful winged 'love';",ancient
plato,-350,"but, seriously, the cause of love is as i have said, and this is how lovers really feel. '",ancient
plato,-350,"if the man who is taken by love used to be an attendant on zeus, he will be able to bear the burden of this feathered force with dignity.",ancient
plato,-350,"phaedrus it is one of ares' troops who has fallen prisoner of love if that is the god with whom he took the circuit then if he has the slightest suspicion that the boy he loves has done him wrong, he turns murderous, and he is ready to make a sacrifice of himself as well as the boy. '",ancient
plato,-350,"and that is how he behaves with everyone at every turn, not just with those he loves.",ancient
plato,-350,"everyone chooses his love after his own fashion from among those who are beautiful, and then treats the boy like his very own god, building him up and adorning him as an image to honor and worship.",ancient
plato,-350,"those who followed zeus, for example, choose someone to love who is a zeus himself in the nobility of his soul.",ancient
plato,-350,"so they make sure he has a talent for philosophy and the guidance of others, and once they have found him and are in love with him they do everything to develop that talent.",ancient
plato,-350,"if any lovers have not yet embarked on this practice, then they start to learn, using any source they can and also making progress on their own.",ancient
plato,-350,"for all of this they know they have the boy to thank, and so they love him all the more; and if they draw their inspiration from zeus, then, like the bacchants, they pour it into the soul of the one they love in order to help him take on as much of their own god's qualities as possible.",ancient
plato,-350,"and so it is for followers of apollo or any other god: they take their god's path and seek for their own a boy whose nature is like the god's; and when they have got him they emulate the god, convincing the boy they love and training him to follow their god's pattern and way of life, so far as is possible in each case.",ancient
plato,-350,"this, then, is any true lover's heart's desire: if he follows that desire in the manner i described, this friend who has been driven mad by love will secure a consummati for the one he has befriended that is as beautiful and blissful as i said if, of course, he captures him.",ancient
plato,-350,"the horse that is on the right, or nobler, side is upright in frame and well jointed, with a high neck and a regal nose; his coat is white, his eyes are black, and he is a lover of honor with modesty and self control; companion to true glory, he needs no whip, and is guided by verbal commands alone.",ancient
plato,-350,"now when the charioteer looks in the eye of love, his entire soul is suffused with a sense of warmth and starts to fill with tingles and the goading of desire.",ancient
plato,-350,now at last the lover's soul follows its boy in reverence and awe. ',ancient
plato,-350,"and because he is served with all the attentions due a god by a lover who is not pretending otherwise but is truly in the throes of love, and because he is by nature disposed to be a friend of the man who is serving him (even if he has already been set against love by schoolfriends or others who say that it is shameful to associate with a lover, and initially rejects the lover in consequence), as time goes forward he is brought by his ripening age and a sense of what must be to a point where he lets the man spend time with him.",ancient
plato,-350,"now that he allows his lover to talk and spend time with him, and the man's good will is close at hand, the boy is amazed by it as he realizes that all the friendship he has from his other friends and relatives put together is nothing compared to that of this friend who is inspired by a god. '",ancient
plato,-350,"after the lover has spent some time doing this, staying near the boy (and even touching him during sports and on other occasions), then the spring that feeds the stream zeus named 'desire' when he was in love with ganymede begins to flow mightily in the lover and is partly absorbed by him, and when he is filled it overflows and runs away outside him.",ancient
plato,-350,"it enters through his eyes, which are its natural route to the soul; there it waters the passages for the wings, starts the wings growing, and fills the soul of the loved one with love in return.",ancient
plato,-350,"then the boy is in love, but has no idea what he loves.",ancient
plato,-350,"it is as if he had caught an eye disease from someone else, but could not identify the cause; he does not realize that he is seeing himself in the lover as in a mirror.",ancient
plato,-350,"so when the lover is near, the boy's pain is relieved just as the lover's is, and when they are apart he yearns as much as he is yearned for, because he has a mirror image of love in him 'backlove'",ancient
plato,-350,"though he neither speaks nor thinks of it as love, but as friendship.",ancient
plato,-350,"still, his desire is nearly the same as the lover's, though weaker: he wants to see, touch, kiss, and lie down with him; and of course, as you might expect, he acts on these desires soon after they occur. '",ancient
plato,-350,"when they are in bed, the lover's undisciplined horse has a word to say to the charioteer that after all its sufferings it is entitled to a little fun.",ancient
plato,-350,"meanwhile, the boy's bad horse has nothing to say, but swelling with desire, confused, it hugs the lover and kisses him in delight at his great good will.",ancient
plato,-350,"and whenever they are lying together it is completely unable, for its own part, to deny the lover any favor he might beg to have.",ancient
plato,-350,"so these two also live in mutual friendship (though weaker than that of the philosophical pair), both while they are in love and after they have passed beyond it, because they realize they have exchanged such firm vows that it would be forbidden for them ever to break them and become enemies.",ancient
plato,-350,"in death they are wingless when they leave the body, but their wings are bursting to sprout, so the prize they have won from the madness of love is considerable, because those who have begun the sacred journey in lower heaven may not by law be sent into darkness for the journey under the earth; their lives are bright and happy as they travel together, and thanks to their love",ancient
plato,-350,"these are the rewards you will have from a lover's friendship, my boy, and they are as great as divine gifts should be.",ancient
plato,-350,"a non lover's companionship, on the other hand, is diluted by human self control; all it pays are cheap, human dividends, and though the slavish attitude it engenders in a friend's soul is widely praised as virtue, it tosses the soul around for nine thousand years on the earth and leads it, mindless, beneath it.

plato,-350,"so now, dear love, this is the best and most beautiful palino we could offer as payment for our debt, especially in view of the rather poetical choice of words phaedrus made me use.",ancient
plato,-350,"forgive us our earlier speeches in return for this one; be kind and gracious toward my expertise at love, which is your own gift to me: do not, out of anger, take it away or disable it; and grant that i may be held in higher esteem than ever by those who are beautiful.",ancient
plato,-350,"so that his lover here may no longer play both sides as he does now, but simply devote his life to love through philosophical discussions.'.",ancient
plato,-350,"and, besides the bend, you also don't understand that the most ambitious politicians love speechwriting and long for their writings to survive.",ancient

plato,-350,"otherwise, do you think you could have spoken of it as you did a few minutes ago, first saying that it is harmful both to lover and",ancient
plato,-350,beloved and then immediately afterward that it is the greatest good?,ancient
plato,-350,did i define love at the beginning of my speech?,ancient
plato,-350,"did lysias too, at the start of his love speech, compel us to assume that love is the single thing that he himself wanted it to be?",ancient
plato,-350,"a man in love will wish he had not done you any favors, once his desire dies down phaedrus he certainly seems a long way from doing what we wanted.",ancient
plato,-350,his first words are what a lover would say to his boy as he was concluding his speech.,ancient
plato,-350,"one claimed that one should give one's favors to the lover; the other, to the non lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"i thought you were going to say 'madly,' which would have been the truth, and is also just what i was looking for: we did say, didn't we, that love is a kind of madness?",ancient
plato,-350,"having attributed the inspiration of the prophet to apollo, of the mystic to dionysus, of the poet to the muses, and the fourth part of madness to aphrodite and to love, we said that the madness of love is the best.",ancient
plato,-350,"we used a certain sort of image to describe love's passion; perhaps it had a measure of truth in it, though it may also have led us astray.",ancient
plato,-350,"and having whipped up a not altogether implausible speech, we sang playfully, but also appropriately and respectfully, a storylike hymn to my master and yours, phaedrus to love, who watches over beautiful boys.",ancient
plato,-350,"just so with our discussion of love: whether its definition was or was not correct, at least it allowed the speech to proceed clearly and consistently with itself.",ancient
plato,-350,"then, just as each single body has parts that naturally come in pairs of the same name (one of them being called the right hand and the other the left hand one), so the speeches, having considered unsoundness of mind to be by nature one single kind within us, proceeded to cut it up the first speech cut its left hand part, and continued to cut until it discovered among these parts a sort of love that can be called 'left handed,' which it correctly denounced; the second speech, in turn, led us to the right hand part of madness; discovered a love that shares its name with the other but is actually divine; set it out before us, and praised it as the cause of our greatest goods.",ancient
plato,-350,"well, phaedrus, i am myself a lover of these divisions and collections, so that i may be able to think and to speak; and if i believe phaedrus that someone else is capable of discerning a single thing that is also by nature capable of encompassing many, i follow 'straight behind, in his tracks, as if he were a god.'",ancient
plato,-350,to call him wisdom's lover a philosopher or something similar would fit him better and be more seemly.,ancient
plato,-350,"for nature, my friend, has placed the love of wisdom in his mind.",ancient
plato,-350,"that is the message i will carry to my beloved, isocrates, from the gods of this place; and you have your own message for your lysias.",ancient
plato,-350,many of socrates' followers wrote versions of this love story:,ancient
plato,-350,"platonic love is an intensely affectionate, but not a sexual, relationship; but with socrates and alcibiades it was also a teaching relationship, in which socrates tried to help alcibiades make the transition to manhood by his stimulating conversation.",ancient
plato,-350,"i was the first man to fall in love with you, son of clinias, and now that the others have stopped pursuing you i suppose you're wondering why i'm the only one who hasn't given up and",ancient
plato,-350,"but, alcibiades, your birth, your upbringing, and your education or that of any other athenian is of no concern to anybody, to tell the truth nobody, that is, except perhaps some man who may happen to be in love with you.",ancient
plato,-350,"again, if you care to consider the self control and the decorum of the spartans, their confidence and their composure, their self esteem and their discipline, their courage and their fortitude, and their love of hardship, victory, and honor, you'd consider yourself a mere child in all these respects.",ancient
plato,-350,"but if she heard that this alcibiades who is making this attempt is, in the first place, hardly twenty years old yet, and, secondly, entirely uneducated, and furthermore, when his lover tells him to study and cultivate himself and discipline himself so that he can compete with the king, he says he doesn't want to and that he's happy with the way he is if she heard all that",ancient
plato,-350,"i suppose i mean the sort of friendship and agreement you find when a mother and father agree with a son they love, and when a brother agrees with his brother, and a woman agrees with her husband.",ancient
plato,-350,"so women are not loved by men, insofar as they do their own work.",ancient
plato,-350,"nor are men loved by women, insofar as they do theirs.",ancient
plato,-350,"now if there was someone who loved alcibiades' body, he wouldn't be loving alcibiades, only something that belonged to alcibiades.",ancient
plato,-350,but someone who loved you would love your soul.,ancient
plato,-350,wouldn't someone who loves your body go off and leave you when your beauty is no longer in full bloom?,ancient
plato,-350,"but someone who loves your soul will not leave you, as long as you're making progress.",ancient
plato,-350,"so this is your situation: you, alcibiades, son of clinias, have no lovers and never have had any, it seems, except for one only, and he is your darli socrates, son of sophroniscus and phaenarete.",ancient
plato,-350,"well, this is the reason: i was your only lover",ancient
plato,-350,the others were only lovers of what you had.,ancient
plato,-350,"and that is my greatest fear, that a love of the common people might corrupt you,",ancient
plato,-350,"then my love for you, my excellent friend, will be just like a stork: after hatching a winged love in you, it will be cared for by it in return.",ancient
plato,-350,"alcibiades, full of ambition, encounters socrates, who engages him in conversation and makes him realize how little he understands of what he needs to understand; at the end alcibiades is humiliated and begs socrates to be his teacher and lover.",ancient
plato,-350,"i think you are not unaware of the events of the last few days: archelaus of macedon was in love with a man whose love for archelaus' kingship was greater than archelaus' love for him, and who killed his lover in order to make himself a king and a happy man.",ancient
plato,-350,"for i am just as tempest tossed as creon, and i look forward to victory over your lovers.",ancient
plato,-350,"now, of course, greedy people love to make a profit.",ancient
plato,-350,so it is those who love the good whom you call greedy.,ancient
plato,-350,"but you yourself, do you or don't you love what's good?",ancient
plato,-350,is there something good that you don't love?,ancient
plato,-350,so presumably you love all good things?,ancient
plato,-350,"and you can ask me, too, if i'm not the same; for i will also agree with you that i love good things.",ancient
plato,-350,"but besides you and me, don't you believe that all other people love what's good and hate what's bad?",ancient
plato,-350,"at that time, harmodius himself happened to be a lover of one of the handsome and noble youths of that era.",ancient
plato,-350,"well now, you yourself said that wicked people love profits, both small and large.",ancient
plato,-350,s.h. i walked into the school of dionysius the grammarian and saw there some extremely attractive young men of good family; their lovers were there too.,ancient
plato,-350,and i i'd sat down next to the lover of one of them,ancient
plato,-350,"and the other one a rival lover of the boy, you see, happened to be sitting next to him",ancient
plato,-350,"of the two lovers, this one spent all his time pursuing the liberal studies, while the other, the one he'd just insulted, spent all his time on athletics.",ancient
plato,-350,"now, i don't know what their lovers were feeling, but i was struck senseless as always happens to me when i'm around beautiful young men.",ancient
plato,-350,"it did seem to me, however, that the other lover was struggling no less than i was.",ancient
plato,-350,"the boys were amused by what he said, and they snickered, while the other lover blushed.",ancient
plato,-350,"i am always saying, indeed, that i know virtually nothing, except a certain small subject love,",ancient
plato,-350,"he seemed to me to be amazing in stature and appearance, and everyone there looked to me to be in love with him, they were so astonished and confused by his entrance, and many other lovers followed in his train.",ancient
plato,-350,"and it occurred to me that cydi was the wisest love poet when he gave someone advice on the subject of beautiful boys and said that 'the fawn should beware lest, while taking a look at the lion, he should provide part of the lion's dinner,' because i felt as if i had been snapped up by such a creature.",ancient
plato,-350,and would you say there was a love of such a sort as to be a love of no fine thing but of itself and the other loves?' ',ancient

plato,-350,"so tell me: when someone loves someone else, which of the two becomes the friend of the other, the one who loves or the one who is loved?",ancient
plato,-350,"do you mean,' i said, 'that they both become each other's friend when only one of them loves the other?' '",ancient
plato,-350,"well, what about this: isn't it possible for someone who loves somebody not to be loved by him in return?' '",ancient
plato,-350,isn't this how men are often treated by the young boys they are in love with?,ancient
plato,-350,"they are deeply in love, but they feel that they are not loved back, or even that they are hated.",ancient
plato,-350,"in a case like this, one person loves and the other is loved.",ancient
plato,-350,"is the lover the friend of the loved, whether he is loved in return or not, or is even hated?",ancient
plato,-350,or is the loved the friend of the lover?,ancient
plato,-350,"or in a case like this, when the two do not both love each other, is neither the friend of the other?' '",ancient
plato,-350,"first we thought that if one person loved another, they were both friends.",ancient
plato,-350,"but now, unless they both love each other, neither is a friend.' '",ancient
plato,-350,so nothing is a friend of the lover unless it loves him in return.',ancient
plato,-350,"so there are no horse lovers unless the horses love them back, and no quail lovers, dog lovers, wine lovers, or exercise lovers.",ancient
plato,-350,"and no lovers of wisdom, unless wisdom loves them in return.",ancient
plato,-350,"but do people really love them even though these things are not their friends, making a liar of the poet who said, happy the man who has as friends his children and solid hoofed horses, his hunting hounds and a host abroad?'",ancient
plato,-350,"so what is loved is a friend to the person who loves it, or so it seems,",ancient
plato,-350,"menexenus, whether it loves him or hates him.",ancient
plato,-350,"babies, for example, who are too young to show love but not too young to hate, when they are disciplined by their mother or father, are at that moment, even though they hate their parents then, their very dearest friends.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"so by this line of reasoning it is not the lover who is a friend, but the loved.'",ancient
plato,-350,"then many people are loved by their enemies and hated by their friends, and are friends to their enemies and enemies to their friends if the object of love rather than the lover is a friend.",ancient
plato,-350,"then if this is impossible, that would make the lover the friend of the loved.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"this is the case when you love someone who does not love you, or even hates you.",ancient
plato,-350,"and frequently one is an enemy to a nonenemy, or even to a friend, as happens when you hate someone who does not hate you, or even loves you.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"i said, 'if friends are not those who love, nor those who are loved, nor those who love and are loved?",ancient
plato,-350,what he didn't prize he wouldn't love.' ',ancient
plato,-350,and whoever doesn't love is not a friend.' ',ancient
plato,-350,"lysis be friends with the rich, and the weak with the strong for the sake of assistance and the sick man with the doctor, and in general every ignorant person has to prize the man who knows and love him.",ancient
plato,-350,"and because of disease, a body is forced to welcome and love medicine.'",ancient
plato,-350,but the presence that makes it be bad deprives it of its desire as well as its love for the good.,ancient
plato,-350,"from this we may infer that those who are already wise no longer love wisdom, whether they are gods or men.",ancient
plato,-350,"nor do those love it who are so ignorant that they are bad, for no bad and stupid man loves wisdom.",ancient
plato,-350,"the upshot is that those who are as yet neither good nor bad love wisdom, while all those who are bad do not, and neither do those who are good.",ancient
plato,-350,and it is on account of the bad that the good is loved.,ancient
plato,-350,"for if nothing could still harm us, we would have no need of any assistance, and it would be perfectly clear to us that it was on account of the bad that we prized and loved the good as if the good is a drug against the bad, and the bad is a disease, so that without the disease there is no need for the drug.",ancient
plato,-350,"isn't the good by nature loved on account of the bad by those of us who are midway between good and bad, but by itself and for its own sake it has no use at all?' '",ancient
plato,-350,and is it possible to desire and love something passionately without feeling friendly towards it? ',ancient
plato,-350,"lysis 'that makes sense.' 'haven't we agreed that the friend loves something, and loves it on account of something, and didn't we think then that it was on account of bad that what was neither good nor bad loved the good?'",ancient
plato,-350,but now it looks like some other cause of loving and being loved has appeared.' ',ancient
plato,-350,"then it is what belongs to oneself, it seems, that passionate love and friendship and desire are directed towards, menexenus and lysis.'",ancient
plato,-350,"and if one person desires another, my boys, or loves him passionately, he would not desire him or love him passionately or as a friend unless he somehow belonged to his beloved either in his soul or in some characteristic, habit, or aspect of his soul.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"all right,' i said, 'what belongs to us by nature has shown itself to us as something we must love.' '",ancient
plato,-350,then the genuine and not the pretended lover must be befriended by his boy.',ancient
plato,-350,"if neither the loved nor the loving, nor the like nor the unlike, nor the good, nor the belonging, nor any of the others we have gone through well, there have been so many",ancient
plato,-350,"following him were a good many others, lovers of his, and among them ctesippus, a young man from paeania",ancient
plato,-350,"i give you my word that everyone who does not have this wisdom will wish to have it: first myself, then clinias here, and, in addition to us, this fellow ctesippus and these others, i said, pointing to the lovers of clinias who were already grouped around us.",ancient
plato,-350,"when the others saw him doing euthydemus this, they gathered around too, not only clinias' lovers but the followers of euthydemus and dionysodorus as well.",ancient
plato,-350,"persuade this young man here that he ought to love wisdom and have a care for virtue, and you will oblige both me and all the present company.",ancient
plato,-350,"and for a man who thinks he ought to get this from his father much more than money, and not only from his father but also from his guardians and friends (especially those of his city and elsewhere who claim to be his lovers), and who begs and beseeches them to give him some wisdom, there is nothing shameful, clinias, nor disgraceful if, for the sake of this, he should become the servant or the slave of a lover or of any man, being willing to perform any honorable service in his desire to become wise.",ancient
plato,-350,"now then, since you believe both that it can be taught and that it is the only existing thing which makes a man happy and fortunate, surely you would agree that it is necessary to love wisdom",ancient
plato,-350,such friends and lovers must be worth a lot who desire above all things that their beloved should utterly perish!,ancient
plato,-350,"as far as i can remember it was just about at the point where we finally agreed that it was necessary to love wisdom, wasn't it?",ancient
plato,-350,"now the love of wisdom, or philosophy, is the acquisition of knowledge, isn't that so?",ancient
plato,-350,"well, socrates, i am indeed a person who loves listening and who would be glad to learn something; but all the same i am afraid that i also am not one of euthydemus' sort.",ancient
plato,-350,it was quite lovely.,ancient
plato,-350,"i think i heard his name is agathon, and i wouldn't be surprised if he were pausanias' young love.",ancient
plato,-350,pausanias and agathon are among those who give speeches in praise of love in the .,ancient
plato,-350,"i said, 'son of hipponicus, i have always admired your love of wisdom, and i especially honor and hold it dear now.",ancient
plato,-350,"this is protagoras top secret; not even the spartanizing cults in the other cities know about it, and so you have all these people getting their ears mangled aping the spartans, lacing on leather gloves, exercising fanatically and wearing short capes, as if sparta's political power depended on these things.",ancient
plato,-350,"all of these emulated, loved, and studied spartan culture.",ancient
plato,-350,"the poem is full of details that testify to its excellent composition; indeed, it is a lovely and exquisitely crafted piece, but it would take a long time to go through it from that point of view.",ancient
plato,-350,"so the tenor of this part of the poem is that it is impossible to be a good man and continue to be good, but possible for one and the same person to become good and also bad, and those are best for the longest time whom the gods love.' '",ancient
plato,-350,"this is strong language, and he keeps up his attack on pittacus' maxim throughout the poem: all who do no wrong willingly i praise and love.",ancient
plato,-350,"he perceived that a good man, an honorable man, often forces himself to love and praise someone utterly different from himself, one's alienated father perhaps, or mother, or country.",ancient
plato,-350,"they actually exaggerate their complaints and add gratuitous to protagoras unavoidable hostility, whereas good men conceal the trouble and force themselves to give praise, and if they are angry because their parents or country wronged them, they calm themselves down and reconcile themselves to it, and they force themselves to love and praise their own people.",ancient
plato,-350,"the meaning is that 'on those terms i will never praise anyone, but i am happy with an average man who does no wrong, since i willingly praise and love all' note the lesbian dialect form of the verb 'praise,' since he is addressing pittacus 'all who do no wrong' (this is where the pause should be, before 'willingly') 'willingly i praise and love",ancient
plato,-350,but there are some whom i praise and love unwillingly.,ancient
plato,-350,"but rather anything else sometimes anger, sometimes pleasure, sometimes pain, at other times love, often fear; they think of his knowledge as being utterly dragged around by all these other things as if it were a slave.",ancient
plato,-350,"i say this because i realize that you and i are both now actually sharing a common experience: each of the two of us is a lover of two objects, i of alcibiades, clinias' son, and of philosophy, and you of the demos people of athens, and the demos who's the son of pyrilampes.",ancient
plato,-350,"i notice that in each case you're unable to contradict your beloved, clever though you are, no matter what he says or what he claims is so.",ancient
plato,-350,"you're unable to oppose what your beloveds say or propose, so that if somebody heard you say what you do on their account and was amazed at how absurd that is, you'd probably say if you were minded to tell him the truth that unless somebody stops your beloveds from saying what they say, you'll never stop saying these things either.",ancient
plato,-350,"in that case you must believe that you're bound to hear me say things like that, too, and instead of being surprised at my saying them, you must stop my beloved, philosophy, from saying them.",ancient

plato,-350,even someone who was blindfolded would know from your conversation that you are handsome and still have lovers.,ancient

plato,-350,"because, mind you, if anybody else had ever taken money from there for education, i would have taken by far the most they love my lectures and applaud",ancient
plato,-350,"well just what is it they love to hear about from you, and applaud?",ancient
plato,-350,that's what they most love to hear about.,ancient
plato,-350,"you call fine from the pleasant, and not calling what is pleasant to the other senses fine food and drink, what goes with making love, and all the rest of that sort of.",ancient
plato,-350,"and as for making love, everybody would fight us; they'd say it is most pleasant, but that one should do it, if he does it at all, where no one will see, because it is the foulest thing to be seen.'",ancient
plato,-350,i love to hear you wise men talk.,ancient
plato,-350,therefore because it's not by mastery that they make poems or say many lovely things about their subjects (as you do about homer),ancient
plato,-350,"you assured me that you knew many lovely things about homer, you promised to give a demonstration; but you're cheating me, you're a long way from giving a demonstration.",ancient
plato,-350,"but if you're not a master of your subject, if you're possessed by a divine gift from homer, so that you make many lovely speeches about the poet without knowing anything as i said about you then you're not doing me wrong.",ancient
plato,-350,it's much lovelier to be thought divine.,ancient
plato,-350,"then that is how we think of you, ion, the lovelier way",ancient
plato,-350,can you still make love with a woman?' ',ancient
plato,-350,the reason i asked is that you don't seem to love money too much.,ancient
plato,-350,"just as poets love their poems and fathers love their children, so i those who have made their own money",ancient
plato,-350,"probably, one loves those one considers good and useful and hates those one considers bad and harmful.",ancient

plato,-350,"don't you know that the love of honor and the love of money are despised, and rightly so?",ancient
plato,-350,"and they won't rule for the sake of honor, because they aren't ambitious honor lovers.",ancient
plato,-350,"while i'd always admired the natures of glaucon and adeimantus, i was especially pleased on this occasion, and i said: you are the sons of a great man, and glaucon's lover began his elegy well when he wrote, celebrating your achievements at the battle of megara, sons of ariston, godlike offspring of a famous man.",ancient
plato,-350,"and how could it be anything besides a lover of learning, if it defines what is its own and what is alien to it in terms of knowledge and ignorance?",ancient
plato,-350,but surely the love of learning is the same thing as philosophy or the love of wisdom?,ancient
plato,-350,"then, may we confidently assume in the case of a human being, too, that if he is to be gentle toward his own and those he knows, he must be a lover of learning and wisdom?",ancient
plato,-350,"inachus was the father of io, who was persecuted by hera because zeus was in love with her.",ancient
plato,-350,"moreover, they mustn't be lovers of laughter either, for whenever anyone indulges in violent laughter, a violent change of mood is likely to follow.",ancient
plato,-350,"or what about having zeus, when all the other gods are asleep and he alone is awake, easily forget all his plans because of sexual desire and be so overcome by the sight of hera that he doesn't even want to go inside but wants to possess her there on the ground, saying that his desire for her is even greater than it was when without their parents' knowledge they were first lovers?",ancient
plato,-350,"now, we mustn't allow our men to be money lovers or to be bribable with gifts.",ancient
plato,-350,nor should we agree that he was such a money lover that he would accept the gifts of agamemnon or release the corpse of hector for a ransom but not otherwise.,ancient
plato,-350,"nor will we allow our people to believe that achilles, who was the son of a goddess and of peleus (the most moderate of men and the grandson of zeus) and who was brought up by the most wise chiron, was so full of inner turmoil as to have two diseases in his soul slavishness accompanied by the love of money, on the one hand, and arrogance towards gods and humans, on the other.",ancient
plato,-350,"then we won't allow those for whom we profess to care, and who must grow into good men, to imitate either a young woman or an older one, or one abusing her husband, quarreling with the gods, or bragging because she thinks herself happy, or one suffering misfortune and possessed by sorrows and lamentations, and even less one who is ill, in love, or in labor.",ancient
plato,-350,and isn't what is most beautiful also most loveable?,ancient
plato,-350,"and a musical person would love such people most of all, but he wouldn't love anyone who lacked harmony?",ancient
plato,-350,"i gather that you love or have loved such a boy yourself, and i agree with you.",ancient
plato,-350,but the right kind of love is by nature the love of order and beauty that has been moderated by education in music and poetry?,ancient
plato,-350,"therefore, the right kind of love has nothing mad or licentious about it?",ancient
plato,-350,"then sexual pleasure mustn't come into it, and the lover and the boy he loves must have no share in it, if they are to love and be loved in the right way?",ancient
plato,-350,"we're establishing that if a lover can persuade a boy to let him, then he may kiss him, be with him, and touch him, as a father would a son, for the sake of what is fine and beautiful, but turning to the other things his association with the one he cares about must never seem to go any further than this, otherwise he will be reproached as untrained in music and poetry and lacking in appreciation for what is fine and beautiful.",ancient
plato,-350,"anyway, it has ended where it ought to end, for it ought to end in the love of the fine and beautiful.",ancient
plato,-350,"doesn't whatever love of learning he might have had in his soul soon become enfeebled, deaf, and blind, because he never tastes any learning or investigation or partakes of any discussion or any of the rest of music and poetry, to nurture or arouse it?",ancient
plato,-350,"now, one cares most for what one loves.",ancient
plato,-350,"and someone loves something most of all when he believes that the same things are advantageous to it as to himself and supposes that if it does well, he'll do well, and that if it does badly, then he'll do badly too.",ancient
plato,-350,"it would be ridiculous for anyone to think that spiritedness didn't come to be in cities from such individuals as the thracians, scythians, and others who live to the north of us who are held to possess spirit, or that the same isn't true of the love of learning, which is mostly associated with our part of the world, or of the love of money, which one might say is conspicuously displayed by the phoenicians and egyptians.",ancient
plato,-350,"and not just the young women, but the older ones too like old men in gymnasiums who, even though their bodies are wrinkled and not pleasant to look at, still love to do physical training.",ancient
plato,-350,"and, therefore, won't one be athletic or warlike, while another is unwarlike and no lover of physical training?",ancient
plato,-350,"further, isn't one woman philosophical or a lover of wisdom, while another hates wisdom?",ancient
plato,-350,"as long as the campaign lasts, no one he wants to kiss shall be allowed to refuse, for then, if one of them happens to be in love with another, whether male or female, he'll be all the more eager to win the rewards of valor.",ancient
plato,-350,"now, notice that, wherever something of the sort that's currently called civil war occurs and a city is divided, if either party ravages the land of the others and burns their houses, it's thought that this is abominable and that neither party loves their city, since otherwise they'd never have ravaged their very nurse and mother.",ancient
plato,-350,"then, won't they love greece?",ancient
plato,-350,"do you remember that, if it's rightly said that someone loves something, then he mustn't love one part of it and not another, but he must love all of it?",ancient
plato,-350,but it isn't appropriate for an erotically inclined man to forget that all boys in the bloom of youth pique the interest of a lover of boys and arouse him and that all seem worthy of his care and pleasure.,ancient
plato,-350,"and as for a honey colored boy, do you think that this very term is anything but the euphemistic coinage of a lover who found it easy to tolerate sallowness, provided it was accompanied by the bloom of youth?",ancient
plato,-350,"further, don't you see wine lovers behave in the same way?",ancient
plato,-350,don't they love every kind of wine and find any excuse to enjoy it?,ancient
plato,-350,"and i think you see honor lovers, if they can't be generals, be captains, and, if they can't be honored by people of importance and dignity, they put up with being honored by insignificant and inferior ones, for they desire the whole of honor.",ancient
plato,-350,"and as for the one who's choosy about what he learns, especially if he's young and can't yet give an account of what is useful and what isn't, we won't say that he is a lover of learning or a philosopher, for we wouldn't say that someone who's choosy about his food is hungry or has an appetite for food or is a lover of food instead",ancient
plato,-350,"then many strange people will be philosophers, for the lovers of sights seem to be included, since they take pleasure in learning things.",ancient
plato,-350,"and the lovers of sounds are very strange people to include as philosophers, for they would never willingly attend a serious discussion or spend their time that way, yet they run around to all the dionysiac festivals, omitting none, whether in cities or villages, as if their ears were under contract to listen to every chorus.",ancient
plato,-350,those who love the sight of truth.,ancient
plato,-350,"on one side are those you just now called lovers of sights, lovers of crafts, and practical people; on the other side are those we are arguing about and whom one would alone call philosophers.",ancient
plato,-350,"the lovers of sights and sounds like beautiful sounds, colors, shapes, and everything fashioned out of them, but their thought is unable to see and embrace the nature of the beautiful itself.",ancient
plato,-350,"now that these points have been established, i want to address a question to our friend who doesn't believe in the beautiful itself or any form of the beautiful itself that remains always the same in all respects but who does believe in the many beautiful things the lover of sights who wouldn't allow anyone to say that the beautiful itself is one or that the just is one or any of the rest: 'my dear fellow,' we'll say, 'of all the many beautiful things, is there one that will not also appear ugly?",ancient
plato,-350,"shall we say, then, that these people love and embrace the things that knowledge is set over, as the others do the things that opinion is set over?",ancient
plato,-350,remember we said that the latter saw and loved beautiful sounds and colors and the like but wouldn't allow the beautiful itself to be anything?,ancient
plato,-350,"we won't be in error, then, if we call such people lovers of opinion rather than philosophers or lovers of wisdom and knowledge?",ancient
plato,-350,"as for those who in each case embrace the thing itself, we must call them philosophers, not lovers of opinion?",ancient
plato,-350,let's agree that philosophic natures always love the sort of learning that makes clear to them some feature of the being that always is and does not wander around between coming to be and decaying.,ancient
plato,-350,"and further, let's agree that, like the honor lovers and erotically inclined men we described before, they love all such learning and are not willing to give up any part of it, whether large or small, more valuable or less",ancient
plato,-350,"they must refuse to accept what is false, hate it, and have a love for the truth.",ancient
plato,-350,"it's not only reasonable, it's entirely necessary, for it's necessary for a man who is erotically inclined by nature to love everything akin to or belonging to the boy he loves.",ancient
plato,-350,then is it possible for the same nature to be a philosopher a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?,ancient
plato,-350,then someone who loves learning must above all strive for every kind of truth from childhood on.,ancient
plato,-350,then surely such a person is moderate and not at all a money lover.,ancient
plato,-350,or do you ever expect anyone to love something when it pains him to do it and when much effort brings only small return?,ancient
plato,-350,"then, won't it be reasonable for us to plead in his defense that it is the nature of the real lover of learning to struggle toward what is, not to remain with any of the many things that are believed to be,",ancient
plato,-350,"that, as he moves on, he neither loses nor lessens his erotic love until he grasps the being of each nature itself with the part of his soul that is fitted to grasp it, because of its kinship with it, and that, once getting near what really is and having intercourse with it and having begotten understanding and truth, he knows, truly lives, is nourished, and at that point, but not before is relieved from the pains of giving birth?",ancient
plato,-350,"well, then, will such a person have any part in the love of falsehood, or will he entirely hate it?",ancient
plato,-350,"(the ones who are now called useless) to take charge of a city, whether they want to or not, and compels the city to obey them, or until a god inspires the present rulers and kings or their offspring with a true erotic love for true philosophy.",ancient
plato,-350,"you should not make such wholesale charges against the majority, for they'll no doubt come to a different opinion, if instead of indulging your love of victory at their expense, you soothe them and try to remove their slanderous prejudice against the love of learning, by pointing out what you mean by a philosopher and by defining the philosophic nature and way of life, as we did just now, so that they'll realize that you don't mean the same people as they do.",ancient
plato,-350,"then don't you also agree that the harshness the majority exhibit towards philosophy is caused by those outsiders who don't belong and who've burst in like a band of revellers, always abusing one another, indulging their love of quarrels, and arguing about human beings in a way that is wholly inappropriate to philosophy?",ancient
plato,-350,"they'd erase one thing, i suppose, and draw in another until they'd made characters for human beings that the gods would love as much as possible.",ancient
plato,-350,will they deny that philosophers are lovers of what is or of the truth?,ancient
plato,-350,"we said, if you remember, that they must show themselves to be lovers of their city when tested by pleasure and pain and that they must hold on to their resolve through labors, fears, and all other adversities.",ancient
plato,-350,"but surely it is those who are not lovers of ruling who must rule, for if they don't, the lovers of it, who are rivals, will fight over it.",ancient
plato,-350,"we must also look for someone who has got a good memory, is persistent, and is in every way a lover of hard work.",ancient
plato,-350,"in the first place, no student should be lame in his love of hard work, really loving one half of it, and hating the other half.",ancient
plato,-350,"this happens when someone is a lover of physical training, hunting, or any kind of bodily labor and isn't a lover of learning, listening, or inquiry, but hates the work involved in them.",ancient
plato,-350,and someone whose love of hard work tends in the opposite direction is also lame.,ancient
plato,-350,"they'll be mean with their own money, since they value it and are not allowed to acquire it openly, but they'll love to spend other people's because of their appetites.",ancient
plato,-350,"yes, it is mixed, but because of the predominance of the spirited element, one thing alone is most manifest in it, namely, the love of victory and the love of honor.",ancient
plato,-350,"i think, said adeimantus, that he'd be very like glaucon here, as far as the love of victory is concerned.",ancient
plato,-350,"he'd be more obstinate and less well trained in music and poetry, though he's a lover of it, and he'd love to listen to speeches and arguments, though he's by no means a rhetorician.",ancient
plato,-350,"he'd be gentle to free people and very obedient to rulers, being himself a lover of ruling and a lover of honor.",ancient
plato,-350,"however, he doesn't base his claim to rule on his ability as a speaker or anything like that, but, as he's a lover of physical training and a lover of hunting, on his abilities and exploits in warfare and warlike activities.",ancient
plato,-350,"wouldn't such a person despise money when he's young but love it more and more as he grows older, because he shares in the money loving nature and isn't pure in his attitude to virtue?",ancient
plato,-350,"then, in the end, victory loving and honor loving men become lovers of making money, or money lovers.",ancient
plato,-350,"at the same time, they'd be unwilling to pay mercenaries, because of their love of money.",ancient
plato,-350,there is no other transformation of a young man who is an honor lover into one who is a money lover that's as swift and sure as this.,ancient
plato,-350,"and, seeing the citadel of the young man's soul empty of knowledge, fine ways of living, and words of truth (which are the best watchmen and guardians of the thoughts of those men whom the gods love), they finally occupy that citadel themselves.",ancient
plato,-350,"then, when those clever enchanters and tyrant makers have no hope of keeping hold of the young man in any other way, they contrive to plant in him a powerful erotic love, like a great winged drone, to be the leader of those idle desires that spend whatever is at hand.",ancient
plato,-350,or do you think that erotic love is anything other than an enormous drone in such people?,ancient
plato,-350,is this the reason that erotic love has long been called a tyrant?,ancient
plato,-350,"i think that someone in whom the tyrant of erotic love dwells and in whom it directs everything next goes in for feasts, revelries, luxuries, girlfriends, and all that sort of thing.",ancient
plato,-350,"and driven by the stings of the other desires and especially by erotic love itself (which leads all of them as its bodyguard), won't he become frenzied and look to see who possesses anything that he could take, by either deceit or force?",ancient

plato,-350,"and in all this, the old traditional opinions that he had held from childhood about what is fine or shameful opinions that are accounted just are overcome by the opinions, newly released from slavery, that are now the bodyguard of erotic love and hold sway along with it.",ancient
plato,-350,"now, however, under the tyranny of erotic love, he has permanently become while awake what he used to become occasionally while asleep, and he won't hold back from any terrible murder or from any kind of food or act.",ancient
plato,-350,"but, rather, erotic love lives like a tyrant within him, in complete anarchy and lawlessness as his sole ruler, and drives him, as if he were a city, to dare anything that will provide sustenance for itself and the unruly mob around it (some of whose members have come in from the outside as a result of his keeping bad company, while others have come from within, freed and let loose by his own bad habits).",ancient
plato,-350,"then, are such things more common in anyone besides a tyrannical man, who is maddened by his desires and erotic loves?",ancient
plato,-350,"and isn't this the kind of prison in which the tyrant is held the one whose nature is such as we have described it, filled with fears and erotic loves of all kinds?",ancient
plato,-350,"then, if we said that its pleasure and love are for profit, wouldn't that best determine its central feature for the purposes of our argument and insure that we are clear about what we mean when we speak of this part of the soul, and wouldn't we be right to call it money loving and profit loving?",ancient
plato,-350,does a profit lover learn what the truth itself is socrates/glaucon,ancient
plato,-350,"a philosopher has of necessity tasted the other pleasures since childhood, but it isn't necessary for a profitlover to taste or experience the pleasure of learning the nature of the things that are and how sweet it is.",ancient
plato,-350,then a philosopher is far superior to a profit lover in his experience of both their pleasures.,ancient
plato,-350,"moreover, the instrument one must use to judge isn't the instrument of a profit lover or an honor lover but a philosopher.",ancient
plato,-350,"now, if wealth and profit were the best means of judging things, the praise and blame of a profit lover would necessarily be truest.",ancient
plato,-350,"and if honor, victory, and courage were the best means, wouldn't it be the praise and blame of an honor lover?",ancient
plato,-350,the praise of a wisdom lover and argument lover is necessarily truest.,ancient
plato,-350,"clearly, he gives it to those of a warrior and honor lover, since they're closer to his own than those of a money maker.",ancient
plato,-350,"then the life and pleasure of a profit lover come last, it seems.",ancient
plato,-350,"doesn't his love of honor make him envious and his love of victory make him violent, so that he pursues the satisfaction of his anger and of his desires for honors and victories without calculation or understanding?",ancient
plato,-350,"i'll tell you, even though the love and respect",ancient
plato,-350,"pythagoras is particularly loved for this, and even today his followers are conspicuous for what they call the pythagorean way of life.",ancient
plato,-350,"but, glaucon, if homer had really been able to educate people and make them better, if he'd known about these things and not merely about how to imitate them, wouldn't he have had many companions and been loved and honored by them?",ancient
plato,-350,"protagoras of abdera, prodicus of ceos, and a great many others are able to convince anyone who associates with them in private that he wouldn't be able to manage his household or city unless they themselves supervise his education, and they are so intensely loved because of this wisdom of theirs that their disciples do everything but carry them around on their shoulders.",ancient
plato,-350,"then we'll allow its defenders, who aren't poets themselves but lovers of poetry, to speak in prose on its behalf and to show that it not only gives pleasure but is beneficial both to constitutions and to human life.",ancient
plato,-350,"however, if such a defense isn't made, we'll behave like people who have fallen in love with someone but who force themselves to stay away from him, because they realize that their passion isn't beneficial.",ancient
plato,-350,"in the same way, because the love of this sort of poetry has been implanted in us by the upbringing we have received under our fine constitutions, we are well disposed to any proof that it is the best and truest thing.",ancient
plato,-350,"to its philosophy, or love of wisdom.",ancient
plato,-350,"then if neither of them escapes the gods' notice, one would be loved by the gods and the other hated, as we agreed at the beginning.",ancient
plato,-350,"and won't we also agree that everything that comes to someone who is loved by gods, insofar as it comes from the gods themselves, is the best possible, unless it is the inevitable punishment for some mistake he made in a former life?",ancient
plato,-350,"odysseus got to make its choice last of all, and since memory of its former sufferings had relieved its love of honor, it went around for a long time, looking for the life of a private individual who did his own work, and with difficulty it found one lying off somewhere neglected by the others.",ancient
plato,-350,"for a parallel one has to look to phaedrus, where socrates' two speeches on erotic love, especially the second, similarly deck out philosophical theses in brilliant, image studded rhetorical dress.",ancient
plato,-350,i'd love to listen to someone,ancient
plato,-350,"i'd love to see our city distinguish itself in the way it goes to war and in the way it pursues the war: that it deals with the other cities, one after another, in ways that reflect positively on its own education and training, both in word and deed that is, both in how it behaves toward them and how it negotiates with them.",ancient
plato,-350,"and, being a lover of both war and wisdom, the goddess chose the region that was likely to bring forth men most like herself, and founded it first.",ancient
plato,-350,"the second would be love, mingled with pleasure and pain.",ancient
plato,-350,"so anyone who is a lover of understanding and knowledge must of necessity pursue as primary causes those that belong to intelligent nature, and as secondary all those belonging to things that are moved by others and that set still others in motion by necessity.",ancient
plato,-350,"on the other hand, if a man has seriously devoted himself to the love of learning and to true wisdom, if he has exercised these aspects of himself above all, then there is absolutely no way that his thoughts can fail to be immortal and divine, should truth come within his grasp.",ancient
plato,-350,"now because it has soul in it and had now found a vent to the outside this marrow instilled a life giving desire for emission right at the place of venting, and so produced the love of procreation.",ancient
plato,-350,"it throws her into extreme emergencies, and visits all sorts of other illnesses upon her until finally the woman's desire and the man's love bring them together, and, like plucking the fruit from a tree, they sow the seed into the ploughed field of her womb, living things too small to be visible and still without form.",ancient
plato,-350,"but, in the case of hephaestus and athena, since they possessed a common nature, both because she was his sister of the same father and because they had entered the same pursuits in their love of wisdom and the arts, they both received this land as their portion in a single lot, because it was congenial to their character and was naturally suited to them in its excellence and intelligence.",ancient
plato,-350,"now seaward, but running along the middle of the entire island, was a plain which is said to have been the loveliest of all plains and quite fertile.",ancient
plato,-350,"all of these did that sacred island once bear in that age under a fostering sun products lovely, marvelous, and of abundant bounty.",ancient
plato,-350,"this is what i'm asking; does drinking wine make pleasures and pains, anger and love, more intense?",ancient
plato,-350,"now aren't we affected in this way by all the following conditions anger, love, pride, ignorance and cowardice?",ancient
plato,-350,"but there is one element you could isolate in any account you give, and this is the correct formation of our feelings of pleasure and pain, which makes us hate what we ought to hate from first to last, and love what we ought to love.",ancient
plato,-350,"in the first place, men's isolation prompted them to cherish and love one another.",ancient
plato,-350,and i suppose our prayers on behalf of those whom we love will be for precisely what they themselves pray for on their own behalf?,ancient
plato,-350,a man who is a father loves the child who is his son?,ancient
plato,-350,"like children, we old men love a bit of make",ancient
plato,-350,"everyone who was listening to the address just now about the gods and our dearly beloved ancestors, should now pay attention.",ancient
plato,-350,"it is truer to say that the cause of each and every crime we commit is precisely this excessive love of ourselves, a love which blinds us to the faults of the beloved and makes us bad judges of goodness and beauty and justice, because we believe we should honor our own ego rather than the truth.",ancient
plato,-350,"for these reasons, then, every man must steer clear of extreme love of himself, and be loyal to his superior instead; and he mustn't be put off by shame at the thought of abandoning that 'best friend'.",ancient
plato,-350,"this approach should do the trick, and if in the last resort we are in complete despair about variations from our number of households, and the mutual love of wives and husbands produces an excessive flow of citizens that drives us to distraction, we have that old expedient at hand, which we have often mentioned before.",ancient
plato,-350,"but while he's young and can't help himself, he loves them and they love him; he's forever scampering back to his family and finding his only allies are his relatives.",ancient
plato,-350,"every living creature has an instinctive love of satisfying this desire whenever it occurs, and the craving to do so can fill a man's whole being, so that he remains quite unmoved by the plea that he should do anything except satisfy his lust for the pleasures of the body, so as to make himself immune to all discomfort.",ancient
plato,-350,"dropping on to the ground in wrestling (antaeus), and the use of gloves in boxing (amycus).",ancient
plato,-350,": we also have to take into account the hunting of men, not merely by their enemies in war (such as the raids carried out by robbers and the pursuit of army by army), but by their lovers, who 'pursue' their quarry for many different reasons, some admirable, some execrable.",ancient
plato,-350,"we'd come as close as we could to the real conditions of the contest by putting on practice gloves instead of thongs, so as to get as much practice as possible in delivering and dodging punches.",ancient
plato,-350,but there are sexual urges too of boys and girls and heterosexual love among adults.,ancient
plato,-350,"if you want to get these things straight, you have to analyze the nature of friendship and desire and 'love', as people call it.",ancient
plato,-350,"in either case, when the friendship is particularly ardent, we call it 'love'.",ancient
plato,-350,the first problem here is to discover what this third kind of lover is really after.,ancient
plato,-350,"there is the further difficulty that he himself is confused and torn between two opposing instincts: one tells him to enjoy his beloved, the other forbids him.",ancient
plato,-350,"the lover of the body, hungry for his partner who is ripe to be enjoyed, like a luscious fruit, tells himself to have his fill, without showing any consideration for his beloved's character and disposition.",ancient
plato,-350,but in another case physical desire will count for very little and the lover will be content to gaze upon his beloved without lusting for him a mature and genuine desire of soul for soul.,ancient
plato,-350,"that body should sate itself with body he'll think outrageous; his reverence and respect for self control, courage, high principles and good judgment will make him want to live a life of purity, chaste lover with chaste beloved.",ancient
plato,-350,this combination of the first two is the 'third' love we enumerated a moment ago.,ancient
plato,-350,"so there's your list of the various forms love can take: should the law forbid them all, and keep them out of our community?",ancient
plato,-350,or isn't it obvious that in our state we'd want to see the virtuous kind spring up the love that aims to make a young man perfect?,ancient
plato,-350,"from the day of our birth each of us encounters a complete unanimity of opinion wherever we go; we find it not only in comedies but often in the high seriousness of tragedy too, when we see a thyestes on the stage, or an oedipus or a macareus, the clandestine lover of his sister.",ancient
plato,-350,"at the appropriate age they pair off; the male picks a wife, and female chooses a husband, and forever afterwards they live in a pious and law abiding way, firmly faithful to the promises they made when they first fell in love.",ancient
plato,-350,"but if they are corrupted by seeing and hearing how most other greeks and non greeks go in for 'free' love on a grand scale, they may prove unable to keep themselves in check.",ancient
plato,-350,"this law, or 'pair' of laws, as perhaps we should say, should govern our conduct whenever the sexual urge and the passion of love impel us, wisely or unwisely, to have intercourse.",ancient
plato,-350,so from lawgivers who profess to use the velvet glove rather than the iron fist,ancient
plato,-350,"these almost literally 'charming' stories were told partly for amusement, partly in full earnest; the children heard them related in prayer at sacrifices, and saw acted representations of them a part of the ceremony a child always loves to see and hear; and they saw their own parents praying with the utmost seriousness for themselves and their families in the firm conviction that their prayers and supplications were addressed to gods who really did exist.",ancient
plato,-350,"the names of the motions of soul are: wish, reflection, diligence, counsel, opinion true and false, joy and grief, cheerfulness and fear, love and hate.",ancient
plato,-350,"a citizen must die, for letting a love of money become the obsession of his life.",ancient
plato,-350,"they have a wonderful intelligence, being of kinds that learn quickly and have good memories, and we should say that they know all our thoughts and both love those of us who are noble and good and hate those who are extremely evil, since already with these kinds we are discussing beings that experience pain.",ancient
plato,-350,"it will be inclined towards courage, readily induced to moderation, and the most important feature in such cases since it will be good at learning and remembering, it can greatly enjoy these activities, and so will have a love of learning.",ancient
plato,-350,"and men love to converse with one another about them, and to listen to what the poets say.",ancient
plato,-350,"at last i came to the conclusion that all existing states are badly governed and the condition of their laws practically incurable, without some miraculous remedy and the assistance of fortune; and i was forced to say, in praise of true philosophy, that from her height alone was it possible to discern what the nature of justice is, either in the state or in the individual, and that the ills of the human race would never end until either those who are sincerely and truly lovers of wisdom come into political power, or the rulers of our cities, by the grace of god, learn true philosophy.",ancient
plato,-350,"nor could any city enjoy tranquillity, no matter how good its laws, when its men think they must spend their all on excesses, and be easygoing about everything except the feasts and the drinking bouts and the pleasures of love that they pursue with professional zeal.",ancient
plato,-350,"for dion was in all things quick to learn, especially in the matters upon which i talked with him; and he listened with a zeal and attentiveness i had never encountered in any young man, and he resolved to spend the rest of his life differently from letter most italians and sicilians, since he had come to love virtue more than pleasure and luxury.",ancient
plato,-350,"in spite of previous misfortunes, i advise you, the friends of dion, to imitate his love for his country and his sober way of living and to try to carry out, under better auspices, these plans of his; and what they were you have clearly heard me explain.",ancient
plato,-350,"besides, i thought, it is not an unusual thing that a young man of native intelligence who has overheard some talk of lofty matters should be seized by a love for an ideal of life.",ancient
plato,-350,"for anyone who hears this, who is a true lover of wisdom, with the divine quality that makes him akin to it and worthy of pursuing it, thinks that he has heard of a marvelous quest that he must at once enter upon with all earnestness, or life is not worth living; and from that time forth he pushes himself and urges on his leader without ceasing, until he has reached the end of the journey or has become capable of doing without a guide and finding the way himself.",ancient
plato,-350,"now this is a clear and infallible test to apply to those who love ease and are incapable of strenuous labor, for none of them can ever.",ancient
plato,-350,"if he wrote them, it was from unworthy ambition, either to have them regarded as his own ideas, or to show that he had participated in an education of which he was unworthy if he loved only the reputation that would come from having.",ancient

plato,-350,"socrates tells his devoted friend chaerephon the legend of halcyon, who was transformed by some heavenly power into a sea bird, the better to search for her much beloved husband, who had drowned at sea.",ancient
plato,-350,"they say that it was once a woman, the daughter of aeolus the son of hellen, who ached with love and lamented the death of her wedded husband, ceyx of trachis, the son of eosphorus the dawn star a handsome son of a handsome father.",ancient
plato,-350,yet great is the honor she has been given by the gods because of her love for her husband.,ancient

plato,-350,"whom zeus of the aegis loved in his heart, as did apollo, with every favor, but he never came to the doorsill of old age. '",ancient
aristotle,-320,"further, besides the ways mentioned, what is better and more valued is thought to be prior by nature: ordinary people commonly say of those they specially value and love that they 'have priority'.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"if then every lover in virtue of his love would prefer, viz.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"that the beloved should be such as to grant a favour, and yet should not grant it (for which stands), to the beloved's granting the favour (represented by d) without being such as to grant it (represented by b), it is clear that a (being of such a nature) is preferable to granting the favour.",ancient
aristotle,-320,to receive affection then is preferable in love to sexual intercourse.,ancient
aristotle,-320,love then aims at affection rather than at intercourse.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"a probability and a sign are not identical, but a probability is a reputable proposition: what men know to happen or not to happen, to be or not to be, for the most part thus and thus, is a probability, eg envious men hate, those who are loved show affection.",ancient
aristotle,-320,for a thing always belongs better to that thing because of which it belongs eg that because of which we love is better loved.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"for people who are puzzled to know whether one ought to honour the gods and love one's parents or not need punishment, while those who are puzzled to know whether snow is white or not need perception.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"to love also, used of the frame of mind, has to hate as its contrary, while as used of the physical activity it has none; clearly, therefore, to love is homonymous.",ancient
aristotle,-320,": eg suppose love to be the desire for intercourse; now he who is more intensely in love has not a more intense desire for intercourse, so that both do not become intensified at once",ancient
aristotle,-320,"moreover, from the point of view of degrees, see if the one admits an increase of degree but not the other, or if though both admit it, they do not admit it at the same time; just as it is not the case that a man desires intercourse more intensely, the more intensely he is in love, so that love and the desire for intercourse are not the same.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for some make hot and cold, or again moist and dry, the causes of becoming; while others make odd and even, or again love and strife; and these differ from each other in the way mentioned.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the same is true of any other pair of contraries; for love does not gather strife together and make things out of it, nor does strife make anything out of love, but both act on a third thing different from both.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"certainly the early physicists found no place for chance among the causes which they recognized love, strife, mind, fire, or the like.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"if then it is possible that at any time nothing should be in motion, this must come about in one of two ways: either in the manner described by anaxagoras, who says that all things were together and at rest for an infinite period of time, and that then mind introduced motion and separated them; or in the manner described by empedocles, according to whom the universe is alternately in motion and at rest in motion, when love is making the one out of many, or strife is making many out of one, and at rest in the intermediate periods of time his account being as follows:",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and much the same may be said of the view that such is how things naturally are and that this must be regarded as a principle, as would seem to be the view of empedocles when he says that the constitution of the world is of necessity such that love and strife alternately predominate and cause motion, while in the intermediate period of time there is a state of rest.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the love and strife postulated are not in themselves causes, nor is it of the essence of either that it should be so, the essential function of the former being to unite, of the latter to separate.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"if he is to go on to explain this alternate predominance, he should adduce cases where such a state of things exists, as he points to the fact that among mankind we have something that unites men, namely love, while on the other hand enemies avoid one another: thus from the observed fact that this occurs in certain cases comes the assumption that it occurs also in the universe.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"thus separation and combination are motions in respect of place, and the motion imparted by love and strife takes these forms, the latter separating and the former combining.",ancient
aristotle,-320,this is what empedocles asserts to have occurred under love. ',ancient
aristotle,-320,"hence empedocles begins after the process ruled by love; for he could not have constructed the heaven by building it up out of bodies in separation, making them to combine by the power of love, since our world has its constituent elements in separation, and therefore presupposes a previous state of unity and combination.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but they, owing to their love for their principles, fall into the attitude of men who undertake the defence of a position in argument.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and, to judge by what he says, they can be attached to things and can again be separated from them, especially since strife and love are still fighting with one another.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but neither is it love and strife; for the former is a cause of association only, and the latter only of dissociation.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"(and yet the elements at all events are dissociated not by strife, but by love; since the elements are by nature prior to god, and they too are gods.)",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for it is not an adequate explanation to say that love and strife set things moving, unless the essence of love is a movement of this kind and the essence of strife a movement of that kind.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"is this, then, the movement that love sets going?",ancient
aristotle,-320,"no: for, on the contrary, the natural movement moves earth downwards and resembles dissociation, and strife rather than love is its cause so that in general, too, love rather than strife would seem to be contrary to nature.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and unless love or strife is actually setting them in motion, the bodies themselves have absolutely no movement or rest.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"with such statements, too, he combines the assertion that the order of the world is the same now, in the reign of strife, as it was formerly in the reign of love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,presumably not love and strife:,ancient
aristotle,-320,"i by ether ether divine, by fire destructive fire, by love love, and hate by cruel hate.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"is love the cause of any and every mixture, or only of those that are in the right ratio?",ancient
aristotle,-320,"is love this ratio itself, or is love something over and above this?",ancient
aristotle,-320,"that is why, when this vehicle decays, memory and love cease; they were activities not of thought, but of the composite which has perished; thought is,",ancient
aristotle,-320,"as empedocles said that 'where heads of many a creature sprouted without necks' they afterwards by love's power were combined, so here too objects of thought which were separate are combined, eg 'incommensurate' and 'diagonal': if the combination be of objects past or future the combination of thought includes in its content the date.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"both these animals have horns and are cloven footed; the female, however, of the hippelaphus has no horns.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"it is cloven footed, and has not got teeth in both jaws; and it is cloven footed in the following way",ancient
aristotle,-320,"of blooded and viviparous quadrupeds some have the foot cloven into many parts, as is the case with the hands and feet of man (for some animals are manytoed, as the lion, the dog, and the leopard); others have feet cloven in two, and instead of nails have hooves, as the sheep, the goat, the deer, and the hippopotamus; others are uncloven, such for instance as the solid hooved animals, the horse and the mule.",ancient
aristotle,-320,swine may be either cloven footed or uncloven footed; for there are in illyria and in paeonia and elsewhere solid hooved swine.,ancient
aristotle,-320,the cloven footed animals have two clefts behind; in the solid hooved this part is continuous.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"the great majority of the horned animals are cloven footed by nature, as the ox, the stag, the goat; and a solid hooved animal with a pair of horns has never yet been met with.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but a few animals are known to be single horned and single hooved, as the indian ass; and the oryx is single horned and cloven hooved.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"of all solid hooved animals the indian ass alone has a huckle bone; for the pig, as was said above, is either solid hooved or cloven footed, and consequently has no well formed huckle bone.",ancient
aristotle,-320,of the cloven footed,ancient
aristotle,-320,"of those whose feet are cloven in many parts, none has been observed to have a huckle bone, none of the others any more than man.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the egyptian hippopotamus has a mane like a horse, is cloven footed like an ox, and is snub nosed.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"it has a huckle bone like cloven footed animals, and tusks just visible; it has the tail of a pig, the neigh of a horse, and the dimensions of an ass.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and all these creatures are many toed, and the several toes are cloven apart.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"of fishes whose habitat is in the vicinity of rocks there is a tiny one, which some call the 'ship holder', and which is by some people used as a charm to bring luck in affairs of law and love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"in fishes that are furnished with an undivided liver, the organ lies entirely on the right side; where the liver is cloven from the root, the larger half of the organ is on the right side; for in some fishes the two parts are detached from one another, without any coalescence at the root, as is the case with the dog fish.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the following also is a striking example: a certain woman, having committed adultery, brought forth the one child resembling her husband and the other resembling the adulterous lover.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the first crop of clover is unwholesome, and so is clover over which ill scented water runs; for the clover is sure to get the taint of the water.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"in the thickness of its fur, in its look, in the white of its belly, and in its love of mischief, it resembles the weasel; it is easily tamed; from its liking for honey it is a plague to bee hives; it preys on birds like the cat.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"several birds, however, with cloven toes live near pools or marshes, as, for instance, the anthus lives by the side of rivers; the plumage of this bird is pretty, and it finds its food with ease.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the flowers from which they gather honey are as follows: the spindle tree, the melilot clover, king's spear, myrtle, flowering reed, withy, and broom.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"its legs are hairy; it is cloven footed, and the tail, which resembles that of the ox, seems not big enough for the size of its body.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"again, it sometimes happens that women who have had erotic dreams and men who have made love are more vigorous not in strength but in health.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"that is why, when they are eager to make love, this place is not in the same state as it was before they were excited.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"they inquired what this is, and what its character; how the universe is generated out of it, and by what motor influence, whether, for instance, by strife or love or mind or spontaneous action, the substratum of matter being assumed to have of necessity a certain nature fire, for instance, to have a hot nature, earth a cold one; the former to be light, the latter heavy.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the scanty conceptions to which we can attain of celestial things give us, from their excellence, more pleasure than all our knowledge of the world in which we live; just as a half glimpse of persons that we love is more delightful than an accurate view of other things, whatever their number and dimensions.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but in elephants, though they must be reckoned polydactylous, as their foot has neither cloven nor solid hoof, the fore feet, owing to the great size and weight of the body, are reduced to the condition of mere supports; and indeed their slow motion and unfitness for bending make them useless for any other purpose.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"there are horns, however, in most of the cloven hoofed animals, and in some of those that have a solid hoof, serving them as an offensive weapon.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"other animals again are protected by the possession of tusks; and among these are the swine, though they have a cloven hoof.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"most of the animals that have horns are cloven hoofed; but the indian ass, as they call it, is also reported to be horned, though its hoof is solid.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"still there are some that have but a single horn; the oryx, for instance, and the so called indian ass; in the former of which the hoof is cloven, while in the latter it is solid.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"again, it would appear consistent with reason that the single horn should go with the solid rather than with the cloven hoof.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for hoof, whether solid or cloven, is of the same nature as horn; so that the two naturally undergo division simultaneously and in the same animals.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"again, since the division of the cloven hoof depends on deficiency of material, it is but rationally consistent, that nature, when she gave an animal an excess of material for the hoofs, which thus became solid, should have taken away something from the upper parts and so made the animal to have but one horn.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the spleen in animals that have horns and cloven hoofs, such as the goat, the sheep, and the like, is of a rounded form; excepting when increased size has caused some part of it to extend its growth longitudinally, as has happened in the case of the ox.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"it is single therefore in all the polydactylous kinds, such as man, dog, lion, and the rest; in all the solid hoofed animals also, such as horse, mule, ass; and in all those which, like the pig, though their hoof is cloven, yet are ambidentate.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"such, then, is the form of animals that have either a solid or a cloven hoof.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the horse, the ass, the camel are examples; all of which bear but a single young one at a time, and of which the two former have solid hoofs, while in the last the hoof is cloven.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for in some of these animals there is a solid hoof, and in others a hoof cloven into two, and again in others a foot divided into many parts.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"in the cloven hoofed quadrupeds the lighter character of the hind legs admits of there being a huckle bone; and the presence of the huckle bone prevents them from having a solid hoof, the bony substance remaining in the joint, and therefore being deficient in the foot.",ancient
aristotle,-320,thus it is that most of the animals that have huckle bones are cloven hoofed.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"for the libyan ostrich may be disregarded for the present, and its cloven hoof and other discrepancies of structure as compared with the tribe of birds will be considered further on.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"further, it resembles a bird in being a biped, and a quadruped in having a cloven hoof; for it has hoofs and not toes.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the males have fine spermatic ducts, the females a membranous uterus alongside the intestine, cloven on each side, in which the egg is produced.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"yet this also is impossible, just as much as it is impossible for the parts when full grown to survive and have life in them when torn apart, as empedocles accounts for the creation of animals in the time of his reign of love, saying that 'many heads sprang up without necks', and later on these isolated parts combined into animals.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"yet those who say that semen comes from the whole of the body really have to talk in that way, and as it happened then in the earth during the reign of love, so it happens according to them in the body.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"in those which have the greatest portion in intelligence we find familiarity and love shown also towards the young when perfected, as with men and some quadrupeds; with birds we find it till they have produced and brought up their young, and therefore if the hens do not incubate after laying they get into worse condition, as if deprived of something natural to them.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the cloven footed animals again produce few, except the pig, which belongs to those that produce many.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"some produce one young, some few, some many: for the most part, the solid hoofed produce one, the cloven footed few, the fissipeds many.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"a proof of this is that the elephant is the largest of animals and yet is many toed, and the camel, the next largest, is cloven footed.",ancient
aristotle,-320,", others perfect; the one hoofed and cloven footed perfect, most of the many toed imperfect.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the reason for this is that the one hoofed produce one young one, and the cloven footed either one or two generally speaking; now it is easy to bring the few to perfection.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the pig alone produces both many and perfect young, and thus here alone we find any overlapping; it produces many as do the many toed animals, but is cloven footed or solid hoofed (for there certainly are solid hoofed swine).",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the pig is not a large one), and also it is more often clovenhoofed, striving as it were with the nature of the solid hoofed animals.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but here my wife erythe brings forth erython as her offspring, nymph born maid erythe, to whom i yielded the plain, sacred memorial of love under the shade of the beech.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"on mount tay?getus (it is said) there is a plant called the love plant, which women in the beginning of spring fasten round their necks, and are loved more passionately by their husbands.",ancient
aristotle,-320,he then who is addicted to sweet wine will be a lover of what is sweet rather than of wine.,ancient
aristotle,-320,is it because in beasts of burden and cloven hoofed animals,ancient
aristotle,-320,and love that shineth bright amid the host of immortals.,ancient
aristotle,-320,an indication of this is the delight we take in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves; and above all others the sense of sight.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"(whence even the lover of myth is in a sense a lover of wisdom, for myth is composed of wonders); therefore since they philosophized in order to escape from ignorance, evidently they were pursuing science in order to know, and not for any utilitarian end.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"one might suspect that hesiod was the first to look for such a thing or some one else who put love or desire among existing things as a principle, as parmenides does; for he, in constructing the genesis of the universe, says:",ancient
aristotle,-320,love first of all the gods she planned.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"and hesiod says: first of all things was chaos made, and then broad breasted earth, and love that foremost is among all the immortals, which implies that among existing things there must be a cause which will move things and bring them together.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"these thinkers grasped this cause only; but certain others have mentioned the source of movement, eg those who make friendship and strife, or reason, or love, a principle.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"as the pythagoreans and plato said, are not attributes of something else but are the substance of existing things, or this is not the case, but the substratum is something else, as empedocles says, love; as someone else says, fire; while one says water and one air.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for by earth,' he says, we see earth, by water water, by ether godlike ether, by fire wasting fire, love by love, and strife by gloomy strife.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"eg empedocles as though referring it to something more intelligible says what unity is; for he would seem to say it is love: at least, this is for all things the cause of their being one.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"some name odd and even, some hot and cold, some limit and the unlimited, some love and strife.",ancient
aristotle,-320,for if those who have seen most of what truth is possible for us (and these are those who seek and love it most),ancient
aristotle,-320,"therefore we must not say, if we are to speak rightly, that of that which is endowed with feet one part has feathers and one is featherless; if we say this we say it through incapacity; we must divide it into cloven footed or not cloven; for these are differentiae in the foot; cloven footedness is a form of footedness.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"what the one is and how we must conceive of it, whether we (i) must take the one itself as being a substance (as both the pythagoreans say in earlier and plato in later times), or there is, rather, an underlying nature and it is to be explained more intelligibly and more in the manner of the natural philosophers, of whom one says the one is love, another says it is air, and another the indefinite.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"that actuality is prior is testified by anaxagoras (for his thought is actuality) and by empedocles in his doctrine of love and strife, and by those who say that there is always movement, eg leucippus.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"thus it produces motion by being loved, and it moves the other moving things.",ancient
aristotle,-320,empedocles also has a paradoxical view; for he identifies the good with love.,ancient
aristotle,-320,in which respect then is love a principle?,ancient
aristotle,-320,"to judge from the lives that men lead, most men, and men of the most vulgar type, seem (not without some reason) to identify the good, or happiness, with pleasure; which is the reason why they love the life of enjoyment.",ancient
aristotle,-320,and so one might rather take the aforenamed objects to be ends; for they are loved for themselves.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"but let us discuss these matters elsewhere; an objection to what we have said, however, may be discerned in the fact that the platonists have not been speaking about all goods, and that the goods that are pursued and loved for themselves are called good by reference to a single form, while those which tend to produce or to preserve these somehow or to prevent their contraries are called so by reference to these, and in a different sense.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for pleasure is a state of soul, and to each man that which he is said to be a lover of is pleasant; eg not only is a horse pleasant to the lover of horses, and a spectacle to the lover of sights, but also in the same way",ancient
aristotle,-320,just acts are pleasant to the lover of justice and in general excellent acts to the lover of excellence.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"now for most men their pleasures are in conflict with one another because these are not by nature pleasant, but the lovers of what is noble find pleasant the things that are by nature pleasant; and excellent actions are such, so that these are pleasant for such men as well as in their own nature.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"is that which is justest, and best is health; but pleasantest is it to win what we love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"by passions i mean appetite, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, love, hatred, longing, emulation, pity, and in general the feelings that are accompanied by pleasure or pain; by faculties the things in virtue of which we are said to be capable of feeling these, eg of becoming angry or being pained or feeling pity; by states",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but to die to escape from poverty or love or anything painful is not the mark of a brave man, but rather of a coward; for it is softness to fly from what is troublesome, and such a man endures death not because it is noble but to fly from evil.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"we may assume the distinction between bodily pleasures and those of the soul, such as love of honour and love of learning; for the lover of each of these delights in that of which he is a lover, the body being in no way affected, but rather the mind; but men who are concerned with such pleasures are called neither temperate nor self indulgent.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"to delight in such things, then, and to love them above all others, is brutish.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"of the appetites some seem to be common, others to be peculiar to individuals and acquired; eg the appetite for food is natural, since every one who is without it craves for food or drink, and sometimes for both, and for love also (as homer says) if he is young and lusty; but not every one craves for this or that kind of nourishment or love, nor for the same things.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for he who neglects these conditions loves such pleasures more than they are worth, but the temperate man is not that sort of person, but the sort of person that right reason prescribes.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and the liberal are almost the most loved of all excellent characters, since they are useful; and this depends on their giving.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"what is common to them is evidently sordid love of gain; they all put up with a bad name for the sake of gain, and little gain at that.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but the gamester and the footpad belong to the class of the mean, since they have a sordid love of gain.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"both, then, since they are willing to make gain from wrong sources, are sordid lovers of gain; therefore all such forms of taking are mean.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"he must also be open in his hate and in his love (for to conceal one's feelings is a mark of timidity), and must care more for truth than for what people will think, and must speak and act openly; for he is free of speech because he is contemptuous, and he is given to telling the truth, except when he speaks in irony to the vulgar.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but sometimes we praise the ambitious man as being manly and a lover of what is noble, and the unambitious man as being moderate and temperate as we said in our first treatment of the subject.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"evidently, since people are said to be fond of such and such in more than one way, we do not assign the term 'ambition' always to the same thing, but when we praise the quality we think of the man who loves honour more than most people, and when we blame it we think of him who loves it more than is right.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for the man who loves truth, and is truthful where nothing is at stake, will still more be truthful where something is at stake; he will avoid falsehood as something base, seeing that he avoided it even for its own sake; and omitting bywater's kai eironeias.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and in a sense chance and art are concerned with the same objects; as agathon says, 'art loves chance and chance loves art'.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the lover of amusement, too, is thought to be self indulgent, but is really soft.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for amusement is a relaxation, since it is a rest; and the lover of amusement is one of the people who go to excess in this.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"again, parent seems by nature to feel it for offspring and offspring for parent, not only among men but among birds and among most animals; it is felt mutually by members of the same race, and especially by men, whence we praise lovers of their fellow men.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but it is not only necessary but also noble; for we praise those who love their friends, and it is thought to be a fine thing to have many friends; and again we think it is the same people that are good men and are friends.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"on this very question they inquire more deeply and in a more scientific fashion, euripides saying that 'parched earth loves the rain, and stately heaven when filled with rain loves to fall to earth', and heraclitus",ancient
aristotle,-320,the kinds of friendship may perhaps be cleared up if we first come to know the object of love.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"for not everything seems to be loved but only the lovable, and this is good, pleasant, or useful; but it would seem to be that by which some good or pleasure is produced that is useful, so that it is the good and the pleasant that are lovable as ends.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"do men love, then, the good, or what is good for them?",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now it is thought that each loves what is good for himself, and that the good is without qualification lovable, and what is good for each man is lovable for him; but each man loves not what is good for him but what seems good.",ancient
aristotle,-320,now there are three grounds on which people love; of the love of lifeless objects we do not use the word 'friendship',ancient
aristotle,-320,"; for it is not mutual love, nor is there a wishing of good to the other (for it would surely be ridiculous to wish wine well; if one wishes anything for it, it is that it may keep, so that one may have it oneself); but to a friend we say we ought to wish what is good for his sake.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now these reasons differ from each other in kind; so therefore, do the corresponding forms of love and friendship.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"there are therefore three kinds of friendship, equal in number to the things that are lovable; for with respect to each there is a mutual and recognized love, and those who love each other wish well a to each other in that respect in which they love one another.",ancient
aristotle,-320,now those who love each other for their utility do not love each other for themselves but in virtue of some good which they get from each other.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"so too with those who love for the sake of pleasure; it is not for their character that men love ready witted people, but because they find them pleasant.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"therefore those who love for the sake of utility love for the sake of what is good for themselves, and those who love for the sake of pleasure do so for the sake of what is pleasant to themselves, and not in so far as the other is the person loved but in so far as he is useful or pleasant.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and thus these friendships are only incidental; for it is not as being the man he is that the loved person is loved, but as providing some good or pleasure.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"such friendships, then, are easily dissolved, if the parties do not remain like themselves; for if the one party is no longer pleasant or useful the other ceases to love him.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"young people are amorous too; for the greater part of the friendship of love depends on emotion and aims at pleasure; this is why they fall in love and quickly fall out of love, changing often within a single day.",ancient
aristotle,-320,love and friendship therefore are found most and in their best form between such men.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"among men of these sorts too, friendships are most permanent when the friends get the same thing from each other (e.g. pleasure), and not only that but also from the same source, as happens between ready witted people, not as happens between lover and beloved.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for these do not take pleasure in the same things, but the one in seeing the beloved and the other in receiving attentions from his lover; and when the bloom of youth is passing the friendship sometimes passes too (for the one finds no pleasure in the sight of the other, and the other gets no attentions from the first); but many lovers on the other hand are constant, if familiarity has led them to love each other's characters,",ancient
aristotle,-320,but those who exchange not pleasure but utility in their love are both less truly friends and less constant.,ancient
aristotle,-320,those who are friends for the sake of utility part when the advantage is at an end; for they were lovers not of each other but of profit.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"for men apply the name of friends even to those whose motive is utility, in which sense states are said to be friendly (for the alliances of states seem to aim at advantage), and to those who love each other for the sake of pleasure, in which sense children are called friends.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"therefore we too ought perhaps to call such people friends, and say that there are several kinds of friendship firstly and in the proper sense that of good men qua good, and by similarity the other kinds; for it is in virtue of something good and something similar that they are friends, since even the pleasant is good for the lovers of pleasure.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now it looks as if love were a passion, friendship a state; for love may be felt just as much towards lifeless things, but mutual love involves choice and choice springs from a state; and men wish well to those whom they love, for their sake, not as a result of passion but as a result of a state.",ancient
aristotle,-320,and in loving a friend men love what is good for themselves; for the good man in becoming a friend becomes a good to his friend.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"each, then, both loves what is good for himself, and makes an equal return in goodwill and in pleasantness; for friendship is said to be equality, and both of these are found most in the friendship of the good.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"one cannot be a friend to many people in the sense of having friendship of the complete type with them, just as one cannot be in love with many people at once (for love is a sort of excess, and it is the nature of such only to be felt towards one person); and it is not easy for many people at the same time to please the same person very greatly, or perhaps even to be good for him.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for the excellence and the function of each of these is different, and so are the reasons for which they love; the love and the friendship are therefore different also.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"in all friendships implying inequality the love also should be proportional, ie the better should be more loved than he loves, and so should the more useful, and similarly in each of the other cases; for when the love is in proportion to the merit of the parties, then in a sense arises equality, which is held to be characteristic of friendship.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"most people seem, owing to ambition, to wish to be loved rather than to love; which is why most men love flattery; for the flatterer is a friend in an inferior position, or pretends to be such and to love more than he is loved; and being loved seems to be akin to being honoured, and this is what most people aim at.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"in being loved, on the other hand, people delight for its own sake; whence it would seem to be better than being honoured, and friendship to be desirable in itself.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but it seems to lie in loving rather than in being loved, as is indicated by the delight mothers take in loving; for some mothers hand over their children to be brought up, and so long as they know their fate they love them and do not seek to be loved in return (if they cannot have both), but seem to be satisfied if they see them prospering; and they themselves love their children even if these owing to their ignorance give them nothing of a mother's due.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now since friendship depends more on loving, and it is those who love their friends that are praised, loving seems to be the characteristic excellence of friends, so that it is only those in whom this is found in due measure that are lasting friends, and only their friendship that endures.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"under this head, too, one might bring lover and beloved, beautiful and ugly.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"this is why lovers sometimes seem ridiculous, when they demand to be loved as they love; if they are equally lovable their claim can perhaps be justified, but when they have nothing lovable about them it is ridiculous.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the friendship of kinsmen itself, while it seems to be of many kinds, appears to depend in every case on paternal friendship; for parents love their children as being a part of themselves, and children their parents as being something originating from them.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and the length of time produces the same result; parents love their children as soon as these are born, but children love their parents only after time has elapsed and they have acquired understanding or perception.",ancient
aristotle,-320,from these considerations it is also plain why mothers love more than fathers do.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"parents, then, love their children as themselves (for their issue are by virtue of their separate existence a sort of other selves), while children love their parents as being born of them, and brothers love each other as being born of the same parents; for their identity with them makes them identical with each other (which is the reason why people talk of 'the same blood', 'the same stock', and so on).",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the friendship of brothers has the characteristics found in that of comrades (and especially when these are good), and in general between people who are like each other, inasmuch as they belong more to each other and start with a love for each other from their very birth, and inasmuch as those born of the same parents and brought up together and similarly educated are more akin in character; and the test of time has been applied most fully and convincingly in their case.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"this being so, equals must effect the required equalization on a basis of equality in love and in all other respects, while unequals must render what is in proportion to their superiority or inferiority.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for those who are friends on the ground of excellence are anxious to do well by each other (since that is a mark of excellence and of friendship), and between men who are emulating each other in this there cannot be complaints or quarrels; no one is offended by a man who loves him and does well by him if he is a person of nice feeling he takes his revenge by doing well by the other.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now here a common measure has been provided in the form of money, and therefore everything is referred to this and measured by this; but in the friendship of lovers sometimes the lover complains that his excess of love is not met by love in return (though perhaps there is nothing lovable about him), while often the beloved complains that the lover who formerly promised everything now performs nothing.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"such incidents happen when the lover loves the beloved for the sake of pleasure while the beloved loves the lover for the sake of utility, and they do not both possess the qualities expected of them.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"if these be the objects of the friendship it is dissolved when they do not get the things that formed the motives of their love; for each did not love the other person himself but the qualities he had, and these were not enduring",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but the love of characters, as has been said, endures because it is self dependent.",ancient
aristotle,-320,for it was of these attributes that we were the friends; and when these have failed it is reasonable to love no longer.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"but one might complain of another if, when he loved us for our usefulness or pleasantness, he pretended to love us for our character.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"so when a man has made a mistake and has thought he was being loved for his character, when the other person was doing nothing of the kind, he must blame himself; but when he has been deceived by the pretences of the other person, it is just that he should complain against his deceiver and with more justice than one does against people who counterfeit the currency, inasmuch as the wrongdoing is concerned with something more valuable.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but if one accepts another man as good, and he becomes bad and is seen to do so, must one still love him?",ancient
aristotle,-320,"surely it is impossible, since not everything can be loved, but only what is good.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"what is evil neither can nor should be loved; for one should not be a lover of evil, nor become like what is bad; and we have said that like is dear to like.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"whether there is or is not friendship between a man and himself is a question we may dismiss for the present; there would seem to be friendship in so far as he is two or more, to judge from what has been said, and from the fact that the extreme of friendship is likened to one's love for oneself.",ancient
aristotle,-320,and having nothing lovable in them they have no feeling of love to themselves.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"therefore the bad man does not seem to be amicably disposed even to himself, because there is nothing in him to love; so that if to be thus is the height of wretchedness, we should strain every nerve to avoid wickedness and should endeavour to be good; for so one may be both friendly to oneself and a friend to another.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for it does not involve intensity or desire, whereas these accompany friendly feeling; and friendly feeling implies intimacy while goodwill may arise of a sudden, as it does towards competitors in a contest; we come to feel goodwill for them and to share in their wishes, but we would not do anything with them; for, as we said, we feel goodwill suddenly and love them only superficially.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"goodwill seems, then, to be a beginning of friendship, as the pleasure of the eye is the beginning of love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for no one loves if he has not first been delighted by the form of the beloved, but he who delights in the form of another does not, for all that, love him, but only does so when he also longs for him when absent and craves for his presence; so too it is not possible for people to be friends if they have not come to feel goodwill for each other, but those who feel goodwill are not for all that friends; for they only wish well to those for whom they feel goodwill, and would not do anything with them nor take trouble for them.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"benefactors are thought to love those they have benefited, more than those who have been well treated love those that have treated them well, and this is discussed as though it were paradoxical.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for they have no friendly feeling to their debtors, but only a wish that they may be kept safe with a view to what is to be got from them; while those who have done a service to others feel friendship and love for those they have served even if these are not of any use to them and never will be.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"this is what happens with craftsmen too; every man loves his own handiwork better than he would be loved by it if it came alive; and this happens perhaps most of all with poets; for they have an excessive love for their own poems, doting on them as if they were their children.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"this is what the position of benefactors is like; for that which they have treated well is their handiwork, and therefore they love this more than the handiwork does its maker.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the cause of this is that existence is to all men a thing to be chosen and loved, and that we exist by virtue of activity (i.e. by living and acting), and that the handiwork is in a sense, the producer in activity; he loves his handiwork, therefore, because he loves existence.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"further, love is like activity, being loved like passivity; and loving and its concomitants are attributes of those who are the more active.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"again, all men love more what they have won by labour;",ancient
aristotle,-320,"eg those who have made their money love it more than those who have inherited it; and to be well treated seems to involve no labour,",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the question is also debated, whether a man should love himself most, or some one else.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"people criticize those who love themselves most, and call them self lovers, using this as an epithet of disgrace, and a bad man seems to do everything for his own sake, and the more so the more wicked he is and so men reproach him, for instance, with doing nothing of his own accord while the good man acts for honour's sake, and the more so the better he is, and acts for his friend's sake, and sacrifices his own interest.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for men say that one ought to love best one's best friend, and a man's best friend is one who wishes well to the object of his wish for his sake, even if no one is to know of it; and these attributes are found most of all in a man's attitude towards himself, and so are all the other attributes by which a friend is defined; for, as we have said, it is from this relation that all the characteristics of friendship have extended to others.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"all the proverbs, too, agree with this, eg 'a single soul', and 'what friends have is common property', and 'friendship is equality', and 'charity begins at home'; for all these marks will be found most in a man's relation to himself; he is his own best friend and therefore ought to love himself best.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now if we grasp the sense in which each party uses the phrase 'lover of self', the truth may become evident.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"those who use the term as one of reproach ascribe self love to people who assign to themselves the greater share of wealth, honours, and bodily pleasures; for these are what most people desire, and busy themselves about as though they were the best of all things, which is the reason, too, why they become objects of competition.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"so those who are grasping with regard to these things gratify their appetites and in general their feelings and the irrational element of the soul; and most men are of this nature thus the epithet has taken its meaning from the prevailing type of self love, which is a bad one); it is just, therefore, that men who are lovers of self in this way are reproached for being so.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"that it is those who give themselves the preference in regard to objects of this sort that most people usually call lovers of self is plain; for if a man were always anxious that he himself, above all things, should act justly, temperately, or in accordance with any other of the excellences, and in general were always to try to secure for himself the honourable course, no one will call such a man a lover of self or blame him.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but such a man would seem more than the other a lover of self; at all events he assigns to himself the things that are noblest and best, and gratifies the most authoritative element in himself and in all things obeys this; and just as a city or any other systematic whole is most properly identified with the most authoritative element in it, so is a man; and therefore the man who loves this and gratifies it is most of all a lover of self.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"that this is the man himself, then, or is so more than anything else, is plain, and also that the good man loves most this part of him.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"whence it follows that he is most truly a lover of self, of another type than that which is a matter of reproach, and as different from that as living according to reason is from living as passion dictates, and desiring what is noble from desiring what seems advantageous.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"therefore the good man should be a lover of self (for he will both himself profit by doing noble acts, and will benefit his fellows), but the wicked man should not; for he will hurt both himself and his neighbours, following as he does evil passions.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"in this sense, then, as has been said, a man should be a lover of self; but in the sense in which most men are so, he ought not.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"this is why one cannot love several people; love tends to be a sort of excess friendship, and that can only be felt towards one person; therefore great friendship too can only be felt towards a few people.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for this reason people of a manly nature guard against making their friends grieve with them, and, unless he be exceptionally insensible to pain, such a man cannot stand the pain that ensues for his friends, and in general does not admit fellow mourners because he is not himself given to mourning; but women and womanly men enjoy sympathisers in their grief, and love them as friends and companions in sorrow.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"does it not follow, then, that, as for lovers the sight of the beloved is the thing they love most, and they prefer this sense to the others because",ancient
aristotle,-320,"on it love depends most for its being and for its origin, so for friends the most desirable thing is living together?",ancient
aristotle,-320,"whatever it is for whose sake they value life, in that they wish to occupy themselves with their friends; and so some drink together, others dice together, others join in athletic exercises and hunting, or in the study of philosophy, each class spending their days together in whatever they love most in life; for since they wish to live with their friends, they do and share in those things as far as they can.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"one might think that all men desire pleasure because they all aim at life; life is an activity, and each man is active about those things and with those faculties that he loves most; eg the musician is active with his hearing in reference to tunes, the student with his mind in reference to theoretical questions, and so on in each case; now pleasure completes the activities, and therefore life, which they desire.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and this activity alone would seem to be loved for its own sake; for nothing arises from it apart from the contemplating, while from practical activities we gain more or less apart from the action.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for if the gods have any care for human affairs, as they are thought to have, it would be reasonable both that they should delight in that which was best and most akin to them (i.e. intellect) and that they should reward those who love and honour this most, as caring for the things that are dear to them and acting both rightly and nobly.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now if arguments were in themselves enough to make men good, they would justly, as theognis says, have won very great rewards, and such rewards should have been provided; but as things are, while they seem to have power to encourage and stimulate the generous minded among the young, and to make a character which is gently born, and a true lover of what is noble, ready to be possessed by excellence, they are not able to encourage the many to nobility and goodness.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"this is, too, why they say the pains inflicted should be those that are most opposed to the pleasures such men love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for instance, they say that once a woman gave a love potion to somebody; then the man died from the effects of the love potion, and the woman was put on trial before the areopagus; on her appearance she was acquitted, just for the reason that she did not do it with design.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for she gave it in love, but missed her mark",ancient
aristotle,-320,"; hence it was not held to be voluntary, because in giving the love potion she did not give it with the thought of killing.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"again, there are others who appear brave owing to their passions; for instance, those who are in love or are inspired by the gods.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"there are several forms of illiberality; for instance, we call some people niggards and cheese parers, and lovers of base gain, and petty.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"take the line: earth loves the shower, what time the plain is dry.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"it is the opposite, they say, that loves to be friends with the opposite; for among the like there is no room for friendship.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for friendship, we maintain, exists only where there can be a return of affection, but friendship towards god does not admit of love being returned, nor at all of loving.",ancient
aristotle,-320,for it would be strange if one were to say that he loved zeus.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"neither is it possible to have affection returned by lifeless objects, though there is a love for such things, for instance wine or something else of that sort.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"therefore it is not love towards god of which we are in search, nor love towards things without life, but love towards things with life, that is, where there can be a return of affection.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now there is a difference between the lovable and what is to be loved, as between the desirable and what is to be desired.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for that is desirable which is absolutely good, but that is to be desired by each which is good for him; so also that which is absolutely good is lovable, but that is to be loved",ancient
aristotle,-320,"which is good for oneself, so that what is to be loved is lovable, but the lovable is not to be loved.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for what is good for oneself is in a way attached to the good, and so is that which is to be loved to the lovable, and it depends as a consequence upon the good that it should be pleasant and that it should be useful.",ancient
aristotle,-320,now the friendship of the good lies in their loving one another; and they love one another in so far as they are lovable; and they are lovable in so far as they are good. ',ancient
aristotle,-320,rather such a friendship will depend on a man's being one who is to be loved.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"he, then, whose love is based on the pleasant does not love with the love which is based on the good, nor does he whose friendship is based upon the useful.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"if, therefore, some one were to say, 'he whose love is prompted by pleasure is not a friend to so and so; for his friendship is not based on the good', he is having recourse to the friendship of the virtuous, which is a compound of all these, of the good and the pleasant and the useful, so that it is true that he is not a friend in respect of that friendship, but only in respect of the friendship depending on the pleasant or the useful.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"so that euripides says, earth loves the shower, what time the plain is dry, intimating that the friendship of utility has place between these as opposites.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but in all the forms of friendship there is a difference that arises between the partners when they are not on a level in love or in benefaction or in service, or whatever else of the kind it may be.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"if, then, you do me more good than i do you, i do not even dispute that you ought to be loved more by me; but in a friendship where we are not friends with the same object, there is more room for differences.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"when men are friends on an unequal footing, those who are superior in wealth or anything of that sort do not think that they themselves ought to love, but think that they ought to be loved by their inferiors.",ancient
aristotle,-320,but it is better to love than to be loved.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"for to love is a pleasurable activity and a good, whereas from being loved there results no activity to the object of the love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"again, it is better to know than to be known; for to be known and to be loved attach even to things without life, but to know and to love to things with life.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"again, to be inclined to benefit is better than not; now he who loves is inclined to benefit, just in so far as he loves, but this is not the case with him who is loved, in so far as he is loved.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but owing to ambition men wish rather to be loved than to love, because of there being a certain superiority in being loved.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for he who is loved has always a superiority in pleasure or wealth or excellence, and the ambitious man reaches out after superiority.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and those who are in a position of superiority do not think that they themselves ought to love, since they make a return to those who love them, in those things in which they are superior.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and again the others are inferior to them, for which reason the superiors do not think they themselves ought to love but to be loved.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but he who is deficient in wealth or pleasures or excellence admires him who has a superiority in these things, and loves him owing to his getting these things or thinking that he will get them.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"among all the above mentioned forms of friendship love is in a way strongest in that which is based on kindred, and more particularly in the relation of father to son.",ancient
aristotle,-320,now why is it that the father loves the son more than the son the father?,ancient
aristotle,-320,this is why the father loves the son more than the son the father.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"since there is, as we maintain, such a thing as friendship towards oneself, will the good man be a lover of self or not?",ancient
aristotle,-320,now the lover of self is he who does everything for his own sake in matters of advantage.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"the bad man is a lover of self (for he does everything for his own sake), but not the good man.",ancient
aristotle,-320,for the reason why he is a good man is because he does so and so for the sake of another; hence he is not a lover of self.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"hence he is not a lover of self as regards such goods at least; but, if at all, in respect of the noble.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"in the choice, then, of things in accordance with the noble he will display his love of self, but in the choice which we describe as being prompted by the useful and the pleasant",ancient
aristotle,-320,will the good man love himself most of all or not?,ancient
aristotle,-320,in a way he will love himself most and in a way not.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"he is therefore a lover of good, not a lover of self.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for, if he does love himself, it is only because he is good.",ancient
aristotle,-320,but the bad man is a lover of self.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"for he has nothing in the way of nobility for which he should love himself, but apart from these grounds he will love himself qua self.",ancient
aristotle,-320,hence it is he who will be called a lover of self in the strict sense.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"for if they are many, it is difficult to apportion one's love to each.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"failing, then, to show love through incapacity one would, not unjustly, incur accusations, and would not be a friend, as one would be loving only in name; but this is not what friendship means.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"nor yet, on the other hand, should one have few, only one or two, but a number commensurate with one's circumstances and one's own impulse to love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"hence, many regard love, anger in some cases, and natural conditions as involuntary, as being too strong for nature; we pardon them as things capable of overpowering nature.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"another kind is due to irrational feeling, eg love or anger; for a man in love is rather foolhardy than timid, and faces many dangers, like him who slew the tyrant in metapontum or the man of whom stories are told in crete.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"if he seeks death to avoid trouble, as many do; to use agathon's words: 'bad men too weak for toil are in love with death,' and so the poets narrate that chiron, because of the pain of his wound, prayed for death and release from his immortality.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now the lover of money is a man eager for actual money, which is a sign of possession taking the place of the accidental use of other possessions.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for the man who knowingly and falsely depreciates himself is a dissembler; the man who exalts himself is a boaster; the man who represents himself as he is, is sincere, and in the homeric phrase honest; in general the one loves truth, the other a lie.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"some, then, describe a friend thus, but others say that opposites are friends; for they say the loved and desired is in every case a friend, but the dry does not desire the dry but",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the sayings, 'earth loves the rain', and 'in all things change is pleasant'; but change is change to an opposite.",ancient
aristotle,-320,some think that bad men cannot be friends but only the good; while others think it strange that mothers should not love their own children.,ancient
aristotle,-320,another puzzle is whether the good or the pleasant is the object of love.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"for if we love what we desire and love is of this kind, for 'none is a lover but one who ever loves' and if desire is for the pleasant, in this way the object of love would be the pleasant; but if it is what we wish for, then it is the good the good and the pleasant being different.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"it is clear, then, that we love both the good and the pleasant.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"since, then, 'good' has many meanings for one thing we call good because its nature is such, and another because it is profitable and useful and further, the pleasant is in part absolutely pleasant and absolutely good, and in part pleasant to a particular individual and apparently good; just as in the case of inanimate things we may choose and love a thing for either of these reasons, so in the case of a man loving one man because of his character or because of excellence, another because he is profitable and useful, another because he is pleasant, and for pleasure.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"so a man becomes a friend when he is loved and returns that love, and this is recognized by the two men in question.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"of these the friendship based on usefulness is that of the majority; men love one another because of their usefulness and to the extent of this; so we have the proverb 'glaucus, a helper is a friend so long he fights', and 'the athenians no longer know the megarians'.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"it is clear from this that the primary friendship, that of good men, is a mutual returning of love and choice.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for what is loved is dear to him who loves it, but a man loving in return is dear to the man loved.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the bad may be friends to one another on the ground both of usefulness and of pleasure; but some deny them to be friends, because there is not the primary friendship between them; for a bad man will injure a bad man, and those who are injured by one another do not love one another; but in fact they do love, only not with the primary friendship.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but those whose love is based on pleasure do not seem to be friends, when we look carefully, because their friendship is not of the primary kind, being unstable, while that is stable; it is, however, as has been said, a friendship, only not the primary kind but derived from it.",ancient
aristotle,-320,we love what is good for ourselves or what is good absolutely?,ancient
aristotle,-320,"and is actual loving attended with pleasure, so that the loved object is pleasant, or not?",ancient
aristotle,-320,", how such a friendship differs from other friendship, and on which of the two goodness or pleasure the loving depends, whether one loves a man because he is good even if not pleasant, and in any case not for his pleasantness.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now, loving having two senses, does actual love seem to involve pleasure because activity is good?",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for its function is an activity, and this is not external, but in the one who feels love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"therefore to love is to feel pleasure, but not to be loved; for to be loved is the activity of what is lovable, but to love is the activity of friendship also; and the one is found only in the animate, the other also in the inanimate, for even inanimate things are loved.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but since active loving is to treat the lov qua loved, and the friend is loved by the friend qua friend and not qua musician or doctor, the pleasure coming from him merely as being himself is the pleasure of friendship; for he loves the object as himself and not for being someone else.",ancient
aristotle,-320,but the bad prefer natural goods to a friend and none of them loves a man so much as things; therefore they are not friends.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"in these varieties there is not at all, or at least not in equal degree, the return of love for love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for it would be ridiculous to accuse a god because the love one receives in return from him is not equal to the love given him, or for the subject to make the same complaint against his ruler.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for the part of a ruler is to receive not to give love, or at least to give love in a different way.",ancient
aristotle,-320,this is obvious in the case of lover and beloved; for this is frequently a cause of strife between them.,ancient
aristotle,-320,the lover does not perceive that the passion in each has not the same reason; therefore. .,ancient
aristotle,-320,a lover would not say such things.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"both are friendships, but only those between whom there is equality are friends; it would be absurd for a man to be the friend of a child, yet certainly he loves and is loved by him.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"sometimes the superior ought to be loved, but if he loves, he is reproached for loving one undeserving; for measurement is made by the worth of the friends and a sort of omitting ouden.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"some then, owing to inferiority in age, do not deserve to receive an equal love, and others because of excellence or birth or some other such superiority possessed by the other person.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the superior ought to claim either not to return the love or not to return it in the same measure, whether in the friendship of utility, pleasure, or excellence.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but when the difference is excessive, then not even those affected seek to make out that their love should be returned or equally returned, eg as if a man were to claim this from a god.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"it is clear then that men are friends when on an equality with each other, but we may have return of love without their being friends.",ancient
aristotle,-320,and it is clear why men seek the friendship of superiority rather than that of equality; for in the former they obtain both love and superiority.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"therefore with some the flatterer is more valued than the friend, for he procures the appearance of both love and superiority for the object of his flattery.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"by nature some grow up loving, and others ambitious; the former is one who delights rather in loving than in being loved, the other tends to be fond of honour.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"he, then, who delights in being loved and admired really loves superiority; the other, the loving, is fond of the pleasure of loving.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"this by his mere activity of loving he must have; for to be loved is an accident; one may be loved without knowing it, but not love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"loving, rather than being loved, depends on lovingness; being loved rather depends on the nature of the object of love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for wishing to be known seems to be felt on one's own account and in order to get, not to do, some good; but wishing to know is felt in order that one may do and love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,therefore we praise those who persist in their love towards the dead; for they know but are not known.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"that, then, there are several sorts of friendship, that they are three in number, and what are the differences between being loved and having love returned, and between friends on an equality and friends in a relation of superiority and inferiority, has now been stated.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"therefore the voices, habits, and company of those of the same species are pleasantest to each side, even in the animals other than man; and in this way it is possible for even the bad to love one another: 'pleasure glues the bad to the bad'.",ancient
aristotle,-320,yet in a sense the love of the contrary is love of the good; for the opposites desire one another because of the mean; they desire one another like tallies because thus out of the two arises a single mean.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"further, the love is accidentally of the opposite, but per se of the mean, for opposites desire not one another",ancient
aristotle,-320,this kind of relation then is found also among inanimate things; but love occurs when the relation is found among the living.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"the number then of kinds of friendship, and the different senses in which we speak of 'friends' and of persons as 'loving' and 'loved', both where this constitutes friendship and where it does not, have now been stated.",ancient
aristotle,-320,for loving and being loved require two separate individuals.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"for some think they are not loved, unless the other wishes them this or that good, some unless their existence or their society is desired.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"further, to sorrow with the sorrowing, for no other reason than their sorrow, we shall regard as love (e.g. slaves grieve with their masters because their masters when in trouble are cruel to them, not for the sake of the masters themselves) as mothers feel towards their children, and birds that share one another's pains.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for he who shows that he loves seems to want to be loved, not to love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,and so fathers love their children and still more mothers more than they are loved by them.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"and these again love their own children more than their parents, because nothing is so good as activity; in fact, mothers love more than fathers because they think the children to be more their own creation; for the amount of work is measured by the difficulty, and the mother suffers more in birth.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but justice seems to be a sort of equality and friendship also involves equality, if the saying is not wrong that 'love is equality'.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for it is hard to measure by just this one unit different directions; we find this in the relation of lovers, for there the one pursues the other as a pleasant person, in order to live with him, while the latter seeks the other at times for his utility.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"when the love is over, one changes as the other changes.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"as regards the good man who is loved for his excellence, we must consider whether we ought to render useful services and help to him, or to one who makes a return and has power.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"those who doing this give all to the object of their love, when they ought not, are worthless.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"some friends wrong one another; they love rather the things than the possessor of them; and so they love the persons much as they choose wine because it is pleasant, or wealth because it is useful; for wealth is more useful than its owner.",ancient
aristotle,-320,hence sensuous love seems like friendship; for the lover aims at ignoring susemihl's lacuna.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"the society of his beloved, but not as ideally he ought, but in a merely sensuous way.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"sometimes we wish the object of our love to be happy away from us, sometimes to share the same fortune as ourselves; the wish to be together is characteristic of friendship.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"it appears to be the mark of one who loves to keep the object of his love from sharing in hardships, but of the beloved to wish to share them; the conduct of both is reasonable.",ancient
aristotle,-320,therefore some kill the objects of their love with themselves.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"for they think that if the objects of their love are to survive they would perceive their own trouble more acutely, just as one who remembered that once he had been happy would feel it more than if he thought himself to be always unhappy. .",ancient
aristotle,-320,"or is it because he is loved, as the phrase is, by a god, success being something coming from without, as a worse built vessel often sails better, not owing to itself but because it has a good pilot?",ancient
aristotle,-320,but it is absurd that a god or divinity should love such a man and not the best and most wise of men.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"liberality is accompanied by a suppleness and ductility of disposition, by kindness, by pitifulness, by love for friends, for strangers, for what is noble.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"its accompaniments are softness, unmanliness, despair, love of life.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"sures, to suppose that those living in such pleasures are in the highest sense happy, to love laughter, jeering, wit, and levity in word and deed.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"it belongs also to excellence to do good to the worthy, to love the good; not to be prompt either to chastise or seek vengeance, but to be complaisant, kindly, and forgiving.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"its accompaniments are worth, equity, indulgence, good hope, and further all such qualities as love of home, love of friends, love of comrades, love of strangers, love of men, love of the noble: all these qualities are among the laudable.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and he who by nature and not by mere accident is without a state, is either a bad man or above humanity; he is like the tribeless, lawless, hearthless one, whom homer denounces the natural outcast is forthwith a lover of war; he may be compared to an isolated piece at draughts.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the rule of a father over his children is royal, for he rules by virtue both of love and of the respect due to age, exercising a kind of royal power.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"again, how strange it is that socrates, after having made the children common, should hinder lovers from carnal intercourse only, but should permit love and familiarities between father and son or between brother and brother, than which nothing can be more unseemly, since even without them love of this sort is improper.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"but the unity which he commends would be like that of the lovers in the symposium, who, as aristophanes says, desire to grow together in the excess of their affection, and from being two to become one, in which case one or both would certainly perish.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"whereas in a state having women and children common, love will be diluted; and the father will certainly not say 'my son', or the son 'my father'.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and the previously mentioned assaults, unlawful loves, homicides, will happen more often among them; for they will no longer call the members of the class they have left brothers, and children, and fathers, and mothers, and will not, therefore, be afraid of com mitting any crimes by reason of consanguinity.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"again, how immeasurably greater is the pleasure, when a man feels a thing to be his own; for surely the love of self is a feeling implanted by nature and not given in vain, although selfishness is rightly censured; this, however, is not the mere love of self, but the love of self in excess, like the miser's love of money; for all, or almost all, men love money and other such objects in a measure.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the old mythologer would seem to have been right in uniting ares and aphrodite, for all warlike races are prone to the love either of men or of women.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"this philolaus was one of the family of the bacchiadae, and a lover of diocles, the olympic victor, who left corinth in horror of the incestuous passion which his mother halcyone had conceived for him, and retired to thebes, where the two friends together ended their days.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"these passed into tyrannies and tyrannies into democracies; for love of gain in the ruling classes was always tending to diminish their number, and so to strengthen the masses, who in the end set upon their masters and established democracies.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"two of them have been already noticed; but they act in a different manner, for men are excited against one another by the love of gain and honour not, as in the case which i have just supposed, in order to obtain them for themselves, but at seeing others, justly or unjustly, monopolising them.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"even trifles are most important when they concern the rulers, as was the case of old at syracuse; for the syracusan constitution was once changed by a love quarrel of two young men, who were in the government.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"his beloved was gained over by his companion, and he to revenge himself seduced the other's wife.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and from a like motive hellanocrates of larissa conspired with him; for when archelaus, who was his lover, did not fulfil his promise of restoring him to his country, he thought that the intercourse between them had originated, not in sexual desire, but in the wish to insult him.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and sometimes men are actuated by more than one motive, like mithridates, who conspired against ariobarzanes, partly out of contempt and partly from the love of gain.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"hence tyrants are always fond of bad men, because they love to be flattered, but no man who has the spirit of a freeman in him will lower himself by flattery; good men love others, or at any rate do not flatter them.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"he should be especially careful of his behaviour to men who are lovers of honour; for as the lovers of money are offended when their property is touched, so are the lovers of honour and the good when their honour is affected.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and it is absurd to suppose that the state changes into oligarchy merely because the ruling class are lovers and makers of money, and not because the very rich think it unfair that the very poor should have an equal share in the government with themselves.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now, passion is the quality of the soul which begets friendship and enables us to love; notably the spirit within us is more stirred against our friends and acquaintances than against those who are unknown to us, when we think that we are despised by them; for which reason archilochus, complaining of his friends, very naturally addresses his spirit in these words, '",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the power of command and the love of freedom are in all men based upon this quality, for passion is commanding and invincible.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"hence the saying, 'cruel is the strife of brethren', and again, 'they who love in excess also hate in excess'.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"now a virtuous wife is best honoured when she sees that her husband is faithful to her, and has no preference for another woman, but before all others loves and trusts her and holds her as his own.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"between a courtesan and her lover, such tempers are allowed their course; between a free woman and her lawful spouse there should be a reverent and modest mingling of love and fear.",ancient
aristotle,-320,beloved sire of my lord,ancient
aristotle,-320,", it is fitting that i fear thee and dread thee and revere'; meaning that her love for him is mingled with fear and modest shame.",ancient
aristotle,-320,for no one ever loves or admires or fears in this shamefaced way one of baser character; but such are the feelings towards one another of nobler souls and those by nature good; or of the inferior toward those they know to be their betters.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"ulysses on the other hand, when the daughter of atlas besought him to share her bed and board, and promised him immortality, could not bring himself even for the sake of immortality to betray the kindness and love and loyalty of his wife, deeming immortality purchased by unrighteousness to be the worst of all punishments.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"for it was only to save his comrades that he yielded his person to circe; and in answer to her he even declared that in his eyes nothing could be more lovely than his native isle, rugged though it were; and prayed that he might die, if only he might look upon his mortal wife and son.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"and he goes on to say that wherever such a love is found, it is a cause of sore distress to those who hate them and of delight to those that love them; while the truth of his words is most of all acknowledged by the happy pair.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the present brings to both what they want; it is a piece of property, which is what the lovers of money desire; and it brings honour, which is what the lovers of honour desire.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"further, a man of a given disposition makes chiefly for the corresponding things: lovers of victory make for victory, lovers of honour for honour, money loving men for money, and so with the rest.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"thus, keenness of sight is more desirable than keenness of smell, sight generally being more desirable than smell generally; and similarly, unusually great love of friends being more honourable than unusually great love of money, love of friends is more honourable than love of money.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the ambitious man does wrong for the sake of honour, the quicktempered from anger, the lover of victory for the sake of victory, the embittered man for the sake of revenge, the stupid man because he has misguided notions of right and wrong, the shameless man because he does not mind what people think of him; and so with the rest any wrong that anyone does to others corresponds to his particular faults of character.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"so also a lover enjoys talking or writing about his loved one, or doing any little thing connected with him; all these things recall him to memory and make him as it were present to the eye of imagination.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"indeed, it is always the first sign of love, that besides enjoying some one's presence, we remember him when he is gone; and we love when we actually feel pain because he is there no longer.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"we can well believe the poet when he says he spake, and in each man's heart he awakened the love of lament.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"friends belong to the class of pleasant things; it is pleasant to love if you love wine, you certainly find it delightful; and it is pleasant to be loved, for this too makes a man see himself as the possessor of goodness, a thing that every being that has a feeling for it desires to possess: to be loved means to be valued for one's own personal qualities.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"that is why we are for the most part fond of our flatterers, our lovers, and honour; also of our children, for our children are our own work.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"also those by doing wrong to whom we shall be gratifying our friends, or those we admire or love, or our masters, or in general the people by reference to whom we mould our lives.",ancient
aristotle,-320,hence people who are afflicted by sickness or poverty or love or thirst or any other unsatisfied desires are prone to anger and easily roused: especially against those who slight their present distress.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"thus a sick man is angered by disregard of his illness, a poor man by disregard of his poverty, a man waging war by disregard of the war he is waging, a lover by disregard of his love, and so in other cases too.",ancient
aristotle,-320,and with those who listen to stories about us or keep on looking at our weaknesses; this seems like either slighting us or hating us; for those who love us share in all our distresses and it must distress anyone to keep on looking at his own weaknesses.,ancient
aristotle,-320,"also towards those who are honest with us, including those who will tell us of their own weak points: it has just been said that with our friends we are not ashamed of what is conventionally wrong, and if we do have this feeling, we do not love them; if therefore we do not have it, it looks as if we did love them.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"we admire those, and wish those to admire us, who possess any good thing that is highly esteemed; or from whom we are very anxious to get something that they are able to give us as a lover feels.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"the deeds or possessions which arouse the love of reputation and honour and the desire for fame, and the various gifts of fortune, are almost all subject to envy; and particularly if we desire the thing ourselves, or think we are entitled to it, or if possession of it puts us a little above others, or a little below them.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"so too we compete with those who follow the same ends as ourselves: we compete with our rivals in sport or in love, and generally with those who are after the same things; and it is therefore these whom we are bound to envy beyond all others.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"they are hot tempered and quick tempered, and apt to give way to their anger; bad temper often gets the better of them, for owing to their love of honour they cannot bear being slighted, and are indignant if they imagine themselves unfairly treated.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"while they love honour, they love victory still more; for youth is eager for superiority over others, and victory is one form of this.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"they love both more than they love money, which indeed they love very little, not having yet learnt what it means to be without it",ancient
aristotle,-320,"they disobey chilon's precept by overdoing everything; they love too much and hate too much, and the same with everything else.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"consequently they neither love warmly nor hate bitterly, but following the hint of bias they love as though they will some day hate and hate as though they will some day love.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"they love life; and all the more when their last day has come, because the object of all desire is something we have not got, and also because we desire most strongly that which we need most urgently.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"their sensual passions have either altogether gone or have lost their vigour: consequently they do not feel their passions much, and their actions are inspired less by what they do feel than by the love of gain.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"hence men at this time of life are often supposed to have a self controlled character; the fact is that their passions have slackened, and they are slaves to the love of gain.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"hence they are querulous, and not disposed to jesting or laughter the love of laughter being the very opposite of querulousness.",ancient
aristotle,-320,"they are luxurious and ostentatious; luxurious, because of the luxury in which they live and the prosperity which they display; ostentatious and vulgar, because, like other people's, their minds are regularly occupied with the object of their love and admiration, and also because they think that other people's idea of happiness is the same as their own.",ancient

empiricism,1739,"no trivial or vulgar object, that causes not a pain or pleasure, independent of the passion, will ever, by its property or other relations either to ourselves or others, be able to produce the affections of pride or humility, love or hatred.",modern

empiricism,1739,"but it is observable, that this repugnance may arise from a difference of degree as well as of kind; nor do we experience a greater difficulty in passing suddenly from a small degree of love to a small degree of hatred, than from a small to a great degree of either of these affections.",modern
empiricism,1739,the idea of the servant conveys our thought most readily to the master; but the hatred or love of the master produces with greater facility anger or good will to the servant.,modern
empiricism,1739,"when we love the father or master of a family, we little think of his children or servants.",modern
empiricism,1739,"i have observed that the transition from love or hatred to pride or humility, is more easy than from pride or humility to love or hatred; and that the difficulty, which the imagination finds in passing from contiguous to remote, is the cause why we scarce have any instance of the latter transition of the affections.",modern
empiricism,1739,"it is evident, that the original passion is pride or humility, whose object is self; and that this passion is transfused into love or hatred, whose object is some other person, notwithstanding the rule i have already established,.",modern
empiricism,1739,"no wonder, then, the imagination returns back again attended with the related passions of love and hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"and indeed, if we consider all the eight experiments i have explained, we shall find that the same principle appears in all of them, and that it is by means of a transition arising from a double relation of impressions and ideas, pride and humility, love and hatred are produced.",modern
empiricism,1739,"ideas or of impressions, it ceases to operate upon the passions, and gives rise neither to pride nor love, humility nor hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"after so many and such undeniable proofs drawn from daily experience and observation, it may seem superfluous to enter into a particular examination of all the causes of love and hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"secondly, in examining the compound affections, which arise from the mixture of love and hatred with other emotions.",modern
empiricism,1739,"by the intention we judge of the actions, and according as that is good or bad, they become causes of love or hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"if that quality in another, which pleases or displeases, be constant and inherent in his person and character, it will cause love or hatred independent of the intention: but otherwise a knowledge and design is requisite, in order to give rise to these passions.",modern
empiricism,1739,"this therefore is one reason, why an intention is requisite to excite either love or hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"the removal of the intention, removes the mortification in the one case, and vanity in the other, and must of course cause a remarkable diminution in the passions of love and hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but then i ask, if the removal of design be able entirely to remove the passion of love and hatred?",modern
empiricism,1739,"the harm and the justice are two contrary objects, of which the one has a tendency to produce hatred, and the other love; and it is according to their different degrees, and our particular turn of thinking, that either of the objects prevails, and excites its proper passion.",modern
empiricism,1739,"having given a reason, why several actions, that cause a real pleasure or uneasiness, excite not any degree, or but a small one, of the passion of love or hatred towards the actors; it will be necessary to shew, wherein consists the pleasure or uneasiness of many objects, which we find by experience to produce these passions.",modern
empiricism,1739,"according to the preceding system there is always required a double relation of impressions and ideas betwixt the cause and effect, in order to produce either love or hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but though this be universally true, it is remarkable that the passion of love may be excited by only one relation of a different kind, viz, betwixt ourselves and the object; or more properly speaking, that this relation is always attended with both the others.",modern
empiricism,1739,"whoever is united to us by any connexion is always sure of a share of our love, proportioned to the connexion, without enquiring into his other qualities.",modern
empiricism,1739,"thus the relation of blood produces the strongest tie the mind is capable of in the love of parents to their children, and a lesser degree of the same affection, as the relation lessens.",modern
empiricism,1739,"we love our country men, our neighbours, those of the same trade, profession, and even name with ourselves.",modern
empiricism,1739,"there is another phaenomenon, which is parallel to this, viz, that acquaintance, without any kind of relation, gives rise to love and kindness.",modern
empiricism,1739,"this must, therefore, be the influencing quality, by which they produce all their common effects; and love or kindness being one of these effects, it must be from the force and liveliness of conception, that the passion is derived.",modern
empiricism,1739,"it is obvious, that people associate together according to their particular tempers and dispositions, and that men of gay tempers naturally love the gay; as the serious bear an affection to the serious.",modern
empiricism,1739,"and as in both cases a love or affection arises from the resemblance, we may learn that a sympathy with others is agreeable only by giving an emotion to the spirits, since an easy sympathy and correspondent emotions are alone common to and.",modern
empiricism,1739,"nothing has a greater tendency to give us an esteem for any person, than his power and riches; or a contempt, than his poverty and meanness: and as esteem and contempt are to be considered as species of love and hatred, it will be proper in this place to explain these phaenomena.",modern
empiricism,1739,"thus we have found, that the first principle, viz, the agreeable idea of those objects, which riches afford the enjoyment of; resolves itself in a great measure into the third, and becomes a sympathy with the person we esteem or love.",modern
empiricism,1739,"self love approaches the power and exercise very near each other in the latter case; but in order to produce a similar effect in the former, we must suppose a friendship and good will to be conjoined with the riches.",modern
empiricism,1739,"this agreeable idea or impression is connected with love, which is an agreeable passion.",modern
empiricism,1739,"it proceeds from a thinking conscious being, which is the very object of love.",modern
empiricism,1739,"one of the most considerable of these passions is that of love or esteem in others, which therefore proceeds from a sympathy with the pleasure of the possessor.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but the possessor has also a secondary satisfaction in riches arising from the love and esteem he acquires by them, and this satisfaction is nothing but a second reflexion of that original pleasure, which proceeded from himself.",modern
empiricism,1739,"in examining those ingredients, which are capable of uniting with love and hatred, i begin to be sensible, in some measure, of a misfortune, that has attended every system of philosophy, with which the world has been yet acquainted.",modern
empiricism,1739,"the passions of love and hatred are always followed by, or rather conjoined with benevolence and anger.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but love and hatred are not compleated within themselves, nor rest in that emotion, which they produce, but carry the mind to something farther.",modern
empiricism,1739,"love is always followed by a desire of the happiness of the person beloved, and an aversion to his misery: as hatred produces a desire of the misery and an aversion to the happiness of the person hated.",modern
empiricism,1739,"so remarkable a difference betwixt these two sets of passions of pride and humility, love and hatred, which in so many other particulars correspond to each other, merits our attention.",modern
empiricism,1739,the conjunction of this desire and aversion with love and hatred may be accounted for by two different hypotheses.,modern
empiricism,1739,"the first is, that love and hatred have not only a cause, which excites them, viz, pleasure and pain; and an object, to which they are directed, viz, a person or thinking being; but likewise an end, which they endeavour to attain,",modern
empiricism,1739,"viz, the happiness or misery of the person beloved or hated; all which views, mixing together, make only one passion.",modern
empiricism,1739,"according to this system, love is nothing but the desire of happiness to another person, and hatred that of misery.",modern
empiricism,1739,the desire and aversion constitute the very nature of love and hatred.,modern
empiricism,1739,"for though it is certain we never love any person without desiring his happiness, nor hate any without wishing his misery, yet these desires arise only upon the ideas of the happiness or misery of our friend or enemy being presented by the imagination, and are not absolutely essential to love and hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"the passions may express themselves in a hundred ways, and may subsist a considerable time, without our reflecting on the happiness or misery of their objects; which clearly proves, that these desires are not the same with love and hatred, nor make any essential part of them.",modern
empiricism,1739,"we may, therefore, infer, that benevolence and anger are passions different from love and hatred, and only conjoined with them, by the original constitution of the mind.",modern
empiricism,1739,"according as we are possessed with love or hatred, the correspondent desire of the happiness or misery of the person, who is the object of these passions, arises in the mind, and varies with each variation of these opposite passions.",modern
empiricism,1739,"love and hatred might have been unattended with any such desires, or their particular connexion might have been entirely reversed.",modern
empiricism,1739,"if nature had so pleased, love might have had the same effect as hatred, and hatred as love.",modern
empiricism,1739,"i see no contradiction in supposing a desire of producing misery annexed to love, and of happiness to hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but though the desire of the happiness or misery of others, according to the love or hatred we bear them, be an arbitrary and original instinct implanted in our nature, we find it may be counterfeited on many occasions, and may arise from secondary principles.",modern
empiricism,1739,"when a person of merit falls into what is vulgarly esteemed a great misfortune, we form a notion of his condition; and carrying our fancy from the cause to the usual effect, first conceive a lively idea of his sorrow, and then feel an impression of it, entirely over looking that greatness of mind, which elevates him above such emotions, or only considering it so far as to encrease our admiration, love and tenderness for him.",modern
empiricism,1739,"we must now proceed to account for the passion of malice, which imitates the effects of hatred, as pity does those of love; and gives us a joy in the sufferings and miseries of others, without any offence or injury on their part.",modern
empiricism,1739,"there is always a mixture of love or tenderness with pity, and of hatred or anger with malice.",modern
empiricism,1739,"for as pity is an uneasiness, and malice a joy, arising from the misery of others, pity should naturally, as in all other cases, produce hatred; and malice, love.",modern
empiricism,1739,"we are, therefore, to look for instances of this peculiar relation of impressions only in such affections, as are attended with a certain appetite or desire; such as those of love and hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"benevolence or the appetite, which attends love, is a desire of the happiness of the person beloved, and an aversion to his misery; as anger or the appetite, which attends hatred, is a desire of the misery of the person hated, and an aversion to his happiness.",modern
empiricism,1739,"and as benevolence has been already found to be connected with love, by a natural and original quality, and anger with hatred; it is by this chain the passions of pity and malice are connected with love and hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"as to the connexion betwixt benevolence and love, anger and hatred, being original and primary, it admits of no difficulty.",modern
empiricism,1739,"we may add to this another experiment, viz, that benevolence and anger, and consequently love and hatred, arise when our happiness or misery have any dependance on the happiness or misery of another person, without any farther relation.",modern
empiricism,1739,"now it is evident, that in the first case, hatred always follows upon the contrariety of interests; as in the second, love arises from their union.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but whether the fortune of a rival or partner be good or bad, i always hate the former and love the latter.",modern
empiricism,1739,this love of a partner cannot proceed from the relation or connexion betwixt us; in the same manner as i love a brother or countryman.,modern
empiricism,1739,"i have endeavoured to prove, that power and riches, or poverty and meanness; which give rise to love or hatred, without producing any original pleasure or uneasiness; operate upon us by means of a secondary sensation derived from a sympathy with that pain or satisfaction, which they produce in the person, who possesses them.",modern
empiricism,1739,"from a sympathy with his pleasure there arises love; from that with his uneasiness, hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"for this reason, pity or a sympathy with pain produces love, and that because it interests us in the fortunes of others, good or bad, and gives us a secondary sensation correspondent to the primary; in which it has the same influence with love and benevolence.",modern
empiricism,1739,"now i assert, that when a sympathy with uneasiness is weak, it produces hatred or contempt by the former cause; when strong, it produces love or tenderness by the latter.",modern
empiricism,1739,"now in order to know what passions are related to these different kinds of sympathy, we must consider, that benevolence is an original pleasure arising from the pleasure of the person beloved, and a pain proceeding from his pain: from which correspondence of impressions there arises a subsequent desire of his pleasure, and aversion to his pain.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but as the extensive or limited sympathy depends upon the force of the first sympathy; it follows, that the passion of love or hatred depends upon the same principle.",modern
empiricism,1739,"a strong impression, when communicated, gives a double tendency of the passions; which is related to benevolence and love by a similarity of direction; however painful the first impression might have been.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but the instance, which makes the most clearly for my hypothesis, is that wherein by a change of the objects we separate the double sympathy even from a midling degree of the passion; in which case we find, that pity, instead of producing love and tenderness as usual, always gives rise to the contrary affection.",modern
empiricism,1739,"when we observe a person in misfortunes, we are affected with pity and love; but the author of that misfortune becomes the object of our strongest hatred, and is the more detested in proportion to the degree of our compassion.",modern
empiricism,1739,"now for what reason should the same passion of pity produce love to the person, who suffers the misfortune, and hatred to the person, who causes it; unless it be because in the latter case the author bears a relation only to the misfortune;",modern
empiricism,1739,"i. shall just observe, before i leave the present subject, that this phaenomenon of the double sympathy, and its tendency to cause love, may contribute to the production of the kindness, which we naturally bear our relations and acquaintance.",modern
empiricism,1739,"nothing that concerns them is indifferent to us; and as this correspondence of sentiments is the natural attendant of love, it readily produces that affection.",modern
empiricism,1739,"there now remains only to explain the passion of respect and contempt, along with the amorous affection, in order to understand all the passions which have any mixture of love or hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"the good qualities of others, from the first point of view, produce love; from the second, humility; and from the third, respect; which is a mixture of these two passions.",modern
empiricism,1739,"the same man may cause either respect, love, or contempt by his condition and talents, according as the person, who considers him, from his inferior becomes his equal or superior.",modern
empiricism,1739,"whereas in esteem or respect, love makes a more considerable ingredient than humility.",modern
empiricism,1739,"all those objects, which cause love, when placed on another person, are the causes of pride, when transfered to ourselves; and consequently ought to be causes of humility, as well as love, while they belong to others, and are only compared to those, which we ourselves possess.",modern
empiricism,1739,"the difficulty then is, why any objects ever cause pure love or hatred, and produce not always the mixt passions of respect and contempt i have supposed all along, that the passions of love and pride, and those of humility and hatred are similar in their sensations, and that the two former are always agreeable, and the two latter painful.",modern
empiricism,1739,nothing invigorates and exalts the mind equally with pride and vanity; though at the same time love or tenderness is rather found to weaken and infeeble it.,modern
empiricism,1739,"let us remember, that pride and hatred invigorate the soul; and love and humility infeeble it.",modern
empiricism,1739,"from this it follows, that though the conformity betwixt love and hatred in the agreeableness of their sensation makes them always be excited by the same objects, yet this other contrariety is the reason, why they are excited in very different degrees.",modern
empiricism,1739,"genius and learning are pleasant and magnificent objects, and by both these circumstances are adapted to pride and vanity; but have a relation to love by their pleasure only.",modern
empiricism,1739,"we may, therefore, consider it as certain, that though the same object always produces love and pride, humility and hatred, according to its different situations, yet it seldom produces either the two former or the two latter passions, in the same proportion.",modern
empiricism,1739,"it is here we must seek for a solution of the difficulty above mentioned, why any object ever excites pure love or hatred, and does not always produce respect or contempt, by a mixture of humility or pride.",modern
empiricism,1739,"suppose, therefore, an object to be presented, which is peculiarly fitted to produce love, but imperfectly to excite pride; this object, belonging to another, gives rise directly to a great degree of love, but to a small one of humility by comparison; and consequently that latter passion is scarce felt in the compound, nor is able to convert the love into respect.",modern
empiricism,1739,"these have a peculiar aptitude to produce love in others; but not so great a tendency to excite pride in ourselves: for which reason the view of them, as belonging to another person, produces pure love, with but a small mixture of humility and respect.",modern
empiricism,1739,"of all the compound passions, which proceed from a mixture of love and hatred with other affections, no one better deserves our attention, than that love, which arises betwixt the sexes, as well on account of its force and violence, as those curious principles of philosophy, for which it affords us an uncontestable argument.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but the most common species of love is that which first arises from beauty, and afterwards diffuses itself into kindness and into the bodily appetite.",modern
empiricism,1739,"the love of beauty is placed in a just medium betwixt them, and partakes of both their natures:",modern
empiricism,1739,"this account of love is not peculiar to my system, but is unavoidable on any hypothesis.",modern
empiricism,1739,the beauty of one person never inspires us with love for another.,modern
empiricism,1739,"this may also serve in another view to illustrate what i have insisted on concerning the origin of pride and humility, love and hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but to pass from the passions of love and hatred, and from their mixtures and compositions, as they appear man, to the same affections, as they display themselves in brutes; we may observe, not only that love and hatred are common to the whole sensitive creation, but likewise that their causes, as above explained, are of so simple a nature, that they may easily be supposed to operate on mere animals.",modern
empiricism,1739,"love in animals, has not for its only object animals of the same species, but extends itself farther, and comprehends almost every sensible and thinking being.",modern
empiricism,1739,"a dog naturally loves a man above his own species, and very commonly meets with a return of affection.",modern
empiricism,1739,"accordingly we find, that by benefits or injuries we produce their love or hatred; and that by feeding and cherishing any animal, we quickly acquire his affections; as by beating and abusing him we never fail to draw on us his enmity and ill will.",modern
empiricism,1739,"love in beasts is not caused so much by relation, as in our species; and that because their thoughts are not so active as to trace relations, except in very obvious instances.",modern
empiricism,1739,"thus acquaintance, which has the same effect as relation, always produces love in animals either to men or to each other.",modern
empiricism,1739,"this impression, like the preceding ones of pride and humility, love and hatred, it is impossible to define, and needless to describe any farther; for which reason we shall cut off all those definitions and distinctions, with which philosophers are wont to perplex rather than dear up this question; and entering at first upon the subject, shall examine that long disputed question concerning liberty and necessity; which occurs so naturally in treating of the will.",modern
empiricism,1739,"these desires are of two kinds; either certain instincts originally implanted in our natures, such as benevolence and resentment, the love of life, and kindness to children; or the general appetite to good, and aversion to evil, considered merely as such.",modern
empiricism,1739,"when a person is once heartily in love, the little faults and caprices of his mistress, the jealousies and quarrels, to which that commerce is so subject; however unpleasant and related to anger and hatred; are yet found to give additional force to the prevailing passion.",modern
empiricism,1739,"upon the removal of pain and pleasure there immediately follows a removal of love and hatred, pride and humility, desire and aversion, and of most of our reflective or secondary impressions.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but supposing that there is an immediate impression of pain or pleasure, and that arising from an object related to ourselves or others, this does not prevent the propensity or aversion, with the consequent emotions, but by concurring with certain dormant principles of the human mind, excites the new impressions of pride or humility, love or hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"love may shew itself in the shape of tenderness, friendship, intimacy, esteem, good will, and in many other appearances; which at the bottom are the same affections; and arise from the same causes, though with a small variation, which it is not necessary to give any particular account of.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but methinks we have been not a little inattentive to run over so many different parts of the human mind, and examine so many passions, without taking once into the consideration that love of truth, which was the first source of all our enquiries.",modern
empiricism,1739,"we love to trace the demonstrations of mathematicians; but should receive small entertainment from a person, who should barely inform us of the proportions of lines and angles, though we reposed the utmost confidence both in his judgment and veracity.",modern
empiricism,1739,"here it is certain, that the utility or importance of itself causes no real passion, but is only requisite to support the imagination; and the same person, who over looks a ten times greater profit in any other subject, is pleased to bring home half a dozen woodcocks or plovers, after having employed several hours in hunting after them.",modern
empiricism,1739,"the same theory, that accounts for the love of truth in mathematics and algebra may be extended to morals, politics, natural philosophy, and other studies, where we consider not the other abstract relations of ideas, but their real connexions and existence.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but beside the love of knowledge, which displays itself in the sciences, there is a certain curiosity implanted in human nature, which is a passion derived from a quite different principle.",modern
empiricism,1739,no enjoyment equals the satisfaction we receive from the company of those we love and esteem; as the greatest of all punishments is to be obliged to pass our lives with those we hate or contemn.,modern
empiricism,1739,"pride and humility, love and hatred are excited, when there is any thing presented to us, that both bears a relation to the object of the passion, and produces a separate sensation related to the sensation of the passion.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but it is certain, that self love, when it acts at its liberty, instead of engaging us to honest actions, is the source of all injustice and violence; nor can a man ever correct those vices, without correcting and restraining the natural movements of that appetite.",modern
empiricism,1739,"in general, it may be affirmed, that there is no such passion in human minds, as the love of mankind, merely as such, independent of personal qualities, of services, or of relation to ourseit",modern
empiricism,1739,"an affection betwixt the sexes is a passion evidently implanted in human nature; and this passion not only appears in its peculiar symptoms, but also in inflaming every other principle of affection, and raising a stronger love from beauty, wit, kindness, than what would otherwise flow from them.",modern
empiricism,1739,"were there an universal love among all human creatures, it would appear after the same manner.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but in the main, we may affirm, that man in general, or human nature, is nothing but the object both of love and hatred, and requires some other cause, which by a double relation of impressions and ideas, may excite these passions.",modern
empiricism,1739,we love company in general; but it is as we love any other amusement.,modern
empiricism,1739,"an englishman in italy is a friend: a euro paean in china; and perhaps a man would be beloved as such, were we to meet him in the moon.",modern
empiricism,1739,"a man naturally loves his children better than his nephews, his nephews better than his cousins, his cousins better than strangers, where every thing else is equal.",modern
empiricism,1739,"so far from thinking, that men have no affection for any thing beyond themselves, i am of opinion, that though it be rare to meet with one, who loves any single person better than himself; yet it is as rare to meet with one, in whom all the kind affections, taken together, do not overbalance all the selfish.",modern
empiricism,1739,"for while each person loves himself better than any other single person, and in his love to others bears the greatest affection to his relations and acquaintance, this must necessarily produce an oppositon of passions, and a consequent opposition of actions; which cannot but be dangerous to the new established union.",modern
empiricism,1739,pity and love are to be considered in the same light.,modern
empiricism,1739,"it is certain, that no affection of the human mind has both a sufficient force, and a proper direction to counterbalance the love of gain, and render men fit members of society, by making them abstain from the possessions of others.",modern
empiricism,1739,"in the mean time, we may content ourselves with observing, that the same love of order and uniformity, which arranges the books in a library, and the chairs in a parlour, contribute to the formation of society, and to the well being of mankind, by modifying the general rule concerning the stability of possession.",modern
empiricism,1739,"i may still do services to such persons as i love, and am more particularly acquainted with, without any prospect of advantage; and they may make me a return in the same manner, without any view but that of recompensing my past services.",modern
empiricism,1739,"it is self love which is their real origin; and as the self love of one person is naturally contrary to that of another, these several interested passions are obliged to adjust themselves after such a manner as to concur in some system of conduct and behaviour.",modern
empiricism,1739,"the same self love, therefore, which renders men so incommodious to each other, taking a new and more convenient direction, produces the rules of justice, and is the first motive of their observance.",modern
empiricism,1739,"men naturally favour those they love; and therefore are more apt to ascribe a right to successful violence, betwixt one sovereign and another, than to the successful rebellion of a subject against his sovereign.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but in order to induce the men to impose on themselves this restraint, and undergo chearfully all the fatigues and expences, to which it subjects them, they must believe, that the children are their own, and that their natural instinct is not directed to a wrong object, when they give a loose to love and tenderness.",modern
empiricism,1739,"but cause, at the same time, the indirect passions of pride or humility, love or hatred, which in this case have a double relation of impressions and ideas to the pain or pleasure.",modern
empiricism,1739,"now since every quality in ourselves or others, which gives pleasure, always causes pride or love; as every one, that produces uneasiness, excites humility or hatred: it follows, that these two particulars are to be considered as equivalent, with regard to our mental qualities, virtue and the power of producing love or pride, vice and the power of producing humility or hatred.",modern
empiricism,1739,"in every case, therefore, we must judge of the one by the other; and may pronounce any quality of the mind virtuous, which causes love or pride; and any one vicious, which causes hatred or humility.",modern
empiricism,1739,"actions themselves, not proceeding from any constant principle, have no influence on love or hatred, pride or humility; and consequently are never considered in morality.",modern
empiricism,1739,"actions are, indeed, better indications of a character than words, or even wishes and sentiments; but it is only so far as they are such indications, that they are attended with love or hatred, praise or blame.",modern
empiricism,1739,"to discover the true origin of morals, and of that love or hatred, which arises from mental qualities, we must take the matter pretty deep, and compare some principles, which have been already examined and explained.",modern

empiricism,1739,"it is seldom men heartily love what lies at a distance from them, and what no way redounds to their particular benefit; as it is no less rare to meet with persons, who can pardon another any opposition he makes to their interest, however justifiable that opposition may be by the general rules of morality.",modern
empiricism,1739,"this is far from being as lively as when our own interest is concerned, or that of our particular friends; nor has it such an influence on our love and hatred: but being equally conformable to our calm and general principles, it is said to have an equal authority over our reason, and to command our judgment and opinion.",modern
empiricism,1739,"virtue in rags is still virtue; and the love, which it procures, attends a man into a dungeon or desart, where the virtue can no longer be exerted in action, and is lost to all the world.",modern

empiricism,1739,"this theory may serve to explain, why the same qualities, in all cases, produce both pride and love, humility and hatred; and the same man is always virtuous or vicious, accomplished or despicable to others, who is so to himself.",modern
empiricism,1739,"wit, and a certain easy and disengaged behaviour, are qualities immediately agreeable to others, and command their love and esteem.",modern
empiricism,1739,"these sentiments produce love or hatred; and love or hatred, by the original constitution of human passion, is attended with benevolence or anger; that is, with a desire of making happy the person we love, and miserable the person we hate.",modern
empiricism,1739,"courage, intrepidity, ambition, love of glory, magnanimity, and all the other shining virtues of that kind, have plainly a strong mixture of self esteem in them, and derive a great part of their merit from that origin.",modern

rationalism,1674,"we love him from our point of view as a humanely kind and accommodating god, and we do not wish to conform to his law, to the immutable order of his divine perfections.",modern
rationalism,1674,"pure charity is so far beyond our strength that no matter how hard we try to love god for himself, or as he is in himself, human reason does not easily understand that it is possible to love in a way other th in relation to self, and to have a different purpose than its own satisfaction.",modern
rationalism,1674,self love is divided into of being and of well being.,modern
rationalism,1674,"self love can be divided into two species, namely, love of grandeur and love of pleasure; or into the love of one's being, and the perfection of one's being, and into the love of one's well being or felicity.",modern
rationalism,1674,"through the love of grandeur we affect power, excellence, independence, and self subsistence of our being.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but by the love of pleasure, they desire not simply being but",modern
rationalism,1674,"consequently, it appears certain to me that pleasure in general, in so far as it contains both rational and sensible pleasures, is the unique motive or principle of natural love or of all the soul's impulses toward any possible good, for one can love only what is pleasing.",modern
rationalism,1674,"if the blessed love the divine perfections, god as he is in himself, it is because the perception of these perfections pleases them.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for since man is made to know and love god, it was necessary that the perception of everything perfect should please them.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but pleasure is always a mode of the mind that by itself makes it happy (and if it is well founded, makes it perfectly content), so that pleasure is well being, and the love of pleasure is the love of well being.",modern
rationalism,1674,"now this love of well being is stronger in us than the love of being; and self love sometimes causes us to desire nonbeing, because we do not have well being.",modern
rationalism,1674,"self love contains two loves then: the love of grandeur, power, indepen the seorch after dence, and generally of all things that appear to us to contribute to the preservation of our being, and the love of pleasure and of all things necessary for our wed being,.e.",modern
rationalism,1674,"these two loves can be divided in many ways either because we are composed of two different parts, body and soul, according to which they may be divided, or because we can distinguish or specify them according to the different objects useful for our preservation.",modern
rationalism,1674,"loves gentleness and peace, and as strong as she is, she sometimes gives in to the pride and arrogance of a lie adorned and anned with her own appeamnces.",modern
rationalism,1674,"consequently, the love we have of ourselves naturally reaches out to include honors and riches.",modern
rationalism,1674,"it is often necessary to consent to injustice to become a magistrate; a solid and uncommon piety often keeps one from benefices, and a generous love for truth often loses men the chairs from which only truth should be taught.",modern
rationalism,1674,the love of pleasure in relation to morality.,modern
rationalism,1674,"for as one can only love what one perceives, this pleasure can only excite a just love, the love of the true cause of happiness.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but it is at the least very dangerous to enjoy pleasures related to sensible objects, which are the perception of them, because these pleasures incline us to love",modern
rationalism,1674,"for although those who are enlightened by the true philosophy sometimes think that pleasure is not caused by external objects, and although this knowledge can to some extent lead them to recognize and love god in all things, nevertheless, since his sin the rational part of man is so feeble, and his senses and imagination have so much power over his mind, that they soon corrupt his heart if he does not deprive himself, according to the counsel of the gospel, of all things that do not of themselves lead to god.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we are naturally convinced that pleasure is the mark of good, and this natural conviction is certainly true, for whatever causes pleasure is certainly quite good and worthy of love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"hence sensible objects are not good, they are not worthy of love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"if they are useful for the preservation of life, we should use them; but as they are not capable of acting in us, we should not love them.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the soul should love only what is good to it, what is capable of making it happier and more perfect.",modern
rationalism,1674,"it should therefore love only what is superior to it, for it is obvious that it can derive its perfection only from what is superior to it.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we should adore and love it; but we should also fear it, since if it can fill us with pleasures, it can also overwhelm us with pains.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we should love it with a voluntary love, an enlightened love, a love worthy of god and ourselves.",modern
rationalism,1674,"our love is worthy of god when we love him because of our knowledge that he is worthy of love; and this love is worthy of us because, being reasonable, we should love what reason makes us know as worthy of our love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but we love sensible things by a love unworthy of ourselves, and undeserved by them because, being reasonable, we love these things without any reason for doing so, since we do not clearly see that they are worthy of love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but pleasure seduces us and makes us love them, the blind and inordinate love of pleasure being the true cause of the false judgments of men in moral subjects.",modern
rationalism,1674,how the love of pleasure ents us from discovering the truth.,modern
rationalism,1674,"the love of pleasure, and the actual enjoyment of pleasure, mal branche which awakens and fortifies the love of it, therefore constantly removes us from truth, throwing us into error.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but since the sin, since the advent of the deranged love of prevenient,dominant, and victorious pleasure, the mind has become so feeble that it can penetrate nothing, and so material and dependent upon its senses that it cannot take hold of anything without a body, or pay attention to abstract truths that do not affect it.",modern
rationalism,1674,the explanation of this is that men's love of pleasure is not as great as their hatred of pain.,modern
rationalism,1674,"they continue such practices for a while, but because they are painful to those lacking in charity, they usually abandon them in order to embrace certain insignificant practices or easy devotions that accord with self love and necessarily subvert the entire morality of jesus christ, but in a way that is imperceptible to them.",modern
rationalism,1674,"in order to understand the cause and the effects of this natural inclination, we must know that god loves all his works and that he joins them closely to one another for their mutual preservation.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for, loving the works he produces (since it is his love that produces them), he also constantly imprints a love for his works in our hearts, because he constantly produces in our hearts a love similar to his own.",modern
rationalism,1674,and in order that the natural love we have for ourselves not nullify and weaken too much that which we have for things external to us,modern
rationalism,1674,"but, on the contrary, that these two loves god has placed in us should uphold and strengthen one another, he has joined us in such a way with everything around us, and especially to beings of our own species, that their ills naturally afflict us, their joy pleases us, and their grandeur, their abasement, their decline, seem to augment or diminish our own being.",modern
rationalism,1674,"god commanded us to love them as we love ourselves; and in order to strengthen our voluntary love of them, he constantly supports and fortifies it by a natural love he impresses in us.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for this reason he has established certain invisible bonds that oblige us as if necessarily to love them, to watch over their preservation as we do our own, and to reganl them as necessary parts of the whole that we together compose, and without which we could not subsist.",modern
rationalism,1674,"finally, in default of charity and love of order, it has been necessary for those who command others to have the art of deceiving them by an imaginary abasement that consists only in civilities and speech, in order that they might enjoy without being envied, that preeminence which is necessary in all bodies.",modern
rationalism,1674,we set no bounds to our love in the person of our friends; together with them we love all the things that pertain to them in any way.,modern
rationalism,1674,"in them, this would be self love; in us, it is generosity.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the similarity of their temperaments, inclinations, functions, airs, ways, virtues, goods, the affection or esteem they show us, the favors that they have done for us or that we hope they will do for us, and several other particular reasons cause us to love them.",modern
rationalism,1674,who loves us for some other particular reason if it happens.,modern
rationalism,1674,"approval and laughter, as is commonly said, are only rarely on the side of truth, but almost always on the side of the people one loves.",modern
rationalism,1674,"this is a man who loves me, who esteems me, who has done for me some favor, who has the disposition and powerto",modern
rationalism,1674,"an honest man should not find fault with anyone for instructing and enlightening him when it is done according to the rules of civility: and when our friends are shocked when we modestly show them that they are mistaken, they must be pennitted to love themselves and their mistakes, since that is what they want and since we do not have the power to command them or to change their minds.",modern
rationalism,1674,", that i should explain the nature of love, hatred, joy, sadness, and all the intellectual passions, whether general or particular.",modern
rationalism,1674,"as a will, it depends essentially on the love god bears for himself, and on the eternal law in a word, on the will of god.",modern
rationalism,1674,"only because god loves himself do we love anylhing, and if god did not love himself, or if he did not continuously impress upon man's soul a love like his own,.e.",modern
rationalism,1674,", the impulse of love that we feel toward the good in general, we would love nothing, we would wiu nothing, and as a result, we would be without a wiu, since the wid is only the impression of nature that leads us toward the good in general, as we have already said a number of times.",modern
rationalism,1674,"although the passions are inseparable from the inclinations, and although men are capable of a certain sensible love or hatred only because they are capable of a spiritual love or hatred, yet i thought that in order to avoid confusion it was proper to treat them separately.",modern
rationalism,1674,"a few tiny th arch aft panicles of bile are rather violently stirred up in the brain therefore, the soul must be excited by some passion, and the passion must be anger rather than love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"in shon, they tell us an infinity of such things that we are led to believe as much for the reason that our pride makes us love independence as because reason instructs us that indeed the greater part of the evils that really afflict us would not be capable of afflicting us if everything were in order.",modern
rationalism,1674,"often their vanity spurs their virtue, because the love of glory is generally stronger than the love of truth and justice.",modern
rationalism,1674,"i am speaking here of the love of glory, not as a simple inclination, but as a passion, because this love can indeed be sensible and because it is often accompanied by very strong and violent disturbances in the animal spirits.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, the love of truth, justice, virtue, or of god himself is always accompanied by motion in the spirits that makes this love sensible, although we are not aware of this because we almost always have other, livelier sensations just as our knowledge of spiritual things is always accompanied by traces in the brain that makes this knowledge livelier, though generally more confused.",modern
rationalism,1674,"given that the ideas of things perceivable only by the pure mind can be linked to traces in the brain, and that the sight of objects we love, hate, or fear through natural inclination can be accompanied by motion in the spirits, clearly the thought of eternity, the fear of hell, and the hope for eternal bliss (although these are objects that do not strike the senses) can excite violent passions in us.",modern
rationalism,1674,"it even happens quite often that faith, charity, and self love make this union with spiritual things stronger than the one we have with all sensible things.",modern
rationalism,1674,the soul is drawn to this object by its love in order to experience it and to enjoy its good through the sensation of delight the author of nature gives it as a natural reward for its seeking the good.,modern
rationalism,1674,"for in fact we hate only because we love, and the external evil is judged evil only in relation to the good of which it deprives us.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, for all the passions, the soul's impulses toward the good are but impulses of love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for in the end, given that every natural impulse is an impression by the author of nature, who acts only for himself, and who can tum us only toward himself, the true impulse of the soul is always essentially the love of good and only accidentally flight from evil.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the third thing we can note in each of our passions is the sensation accompanying them a sensation of love, aversion, desire, joy, or sadness.",modern
rationalism,1674,"sixlh are the different sensations oflove, aversion, joy, desire, sadness caused not by lhe intellectual perception of good or evil, like those just mentioned, but by the different disturbances that the animal spirits cause in the brain.",modern
rationalism,1674,"he immediately hates his enemy only because he loves the good, and his hatred is as great as his love is strong, because the impulse of his will in the passion of hatred is only an impulse of love, since the soul's impulse toward the good is not different from its impulse to flee the privation of good, as we have already said.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the impulse of hatred is the same as that of love, as each of us is capable of knowing from his own experience.",modern
rationalism,1674,"and because we naturally humanize all causes, and furthermore because a soul that does not will, think, and sense is unthinkable, we judge that our dog knows and loves us, and feels pain like our own when injured.",modern
rationalism,1674,"as god has created the dog especially for man, he placed in the dog, in order that man might naturally team up with his dog, a disposition to make certain contortions and movements of the head, back, and tail, which though they are of themselves in no way related to the soul's thoughts, naturally engender in man the thought that his dog loves and cares for him.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the sixth thing to be found is the sensation of passion, a feeling of love, aversion, desire, joy, or sadness.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the perception of some good is naturally followed by an impulse of love, a sensation of love, a disturbance of the brain and movement of the spirits, a new emotion of the soul that increases the first impulse of love, a new seusation of love that increases the first sensation of love, and finally by a sensation of delight that rewards the soul because its body is in its proper state.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we must love the good, they say; pleasure is the sign that nature has attached to the good; by means of this sign, which cannot be deceptive since it comes from god, we distinguish it from evil.",modern
rationalism,1674,sensible pleasure is the mark that nature has attached to the use of cenain things in order that without having to bother with a rational examination we might use them for the preservation of the body but not in order that we might love them.,modern
rationalism,1674,"for we must love only what we clearly recognize through reason to be our good, the true cause of our happiness.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we are rational, and god who is our good does not wish to give us a blind love, an instinctive love, a forced love, as it were, but a love by choice, an enlightened love, a love that subjects our mind and hean to him.",modern
rationalism,1674,"he leads us to love him by revealing through the light accompanying the delight of his grace that he is our good; but he leads us to the good of the body only through instinct and a confused sensation of pleasure, because the good of the body does not deserve the attention of our mind or the exercise of our reason.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we can and must love what is capable of making us sense pleasure, granted.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we must love only god, because only god can act in our soul and because sensible objects can do no more than move our sense organs.",modern
rationalism,1674,"you might think that this is a poor arrangement, reasoning that since pleasure is the mark of good as pain is the mark of evil, we should receive infinitely more delight in our love of god than in using sensible things, seeing that god is the true, or rather the only, good of the mind.",modern
rationalism,1674,"he is no longer our good by nature but only through grace, for we no longer naturally experience delight in his love; far from leading us to love him, he sends us away from him.",modern
rationalism,1674,"finally, it seems that since the fall, god no longer wills that we love him, think about him, or regard him as our only good.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for given that pleasure is the sensible mark of good, we perceive that god is our only good because through the grace of jesus christ our love of god involves pleasure.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, given that the soul does not recognize its good either through clear perception or through sensation without the grace of jesus christ, it takes the good of the body for its own good, loves it, and attaches itself to it still more closely with its will than it had ever been attached by nature's initial arrangement.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the animal spirits are more greatly agitated by it, and, as a result, the will loves it more fervently and with greater pleasure.",modern
rationalism,1674,"god afflicts men in the bottom of their heart when they love something other than him, and this affliction is the cause of true misery.",modern
rationalism,1674,"from what we have just said, it is clear (i) that the object of our passions is not our good; that we must follow their impulses only for the preservation of our life; that sensible pleasure stands to our good as our sensations stand to the truth, and that just as our senses deceive us with regard to the truth, our passions deceive us with regard to the good; that we should yield to the delight of grace because it leads us with certainty to the love of true good, that it is not followed by the secret reproaches of reason as are instinct and the confused pleasure of the passions, and that it is always accompanied by a secret joy in proportion to the state we are in; that finally, since only god can act on the mind of man, man can find no happiness outside of god.",modern
rationalism,1674,unless it is supposed that god rewards disobedience or commands us to love more what in fact deserves to be loved least.,modern
rationalism,1674,"that the mind's perfection consists in its union with god through its knowledge oftruth and love of, irtue, whereas its imperfection springs only from its dependence on the body because of the disorder of its senses and passions.",modern
rationalism,1674,"everyone is convinced that knowledge of truth and love of virtue make the mind more perfect, that mental blindness and disorders of the heart make it more imperfect.",modern
rationalism,1674,"knowledge of truth and love of virtue, therefore, cannot be anything other than the mind's union with god and a kind of possession of god, whereas mental blindness and disorders of the heart cannot be anything other than the mind's separation from god and its union with something below it,.e., with the body.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, to know god is to know the truth or to know things according to the truth, and to love god is to love virtue or to love things to the extent to which they are worthy of love, or according to the rules of virtue.",modern
rationalism,1674,"likewise, when we love according to the rules of virtue, we love god.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for when we love according to these rules, the impression of love that god continuously produces in our heart in order to incline us toward him is neither diverted by free will nor converted into self love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"now, since god never gives it an impression that does not lead toward him, since he acts only for himself, to love according to the rules of virtue is clearly to love god.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but not only is this to love god, it is also to love as god loves.",modern
rationalism,1674,"god loves only himself he loves his creations only because they are related to his perfections, and he loves them to the extent to which they have this relation in the fmal analysis god loves himself and the things he has created with the same love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"to love according to the rules of virtue is to love god alone and to love him in all things; it is to love things to the extent to which they participate in the goodness and the perfections of god, since this is to love them to the extent to which they are worthy of love; finally, it is to love with the impression of the same love by which god loves himself, for it is god's self love and everything related to it that animates us when we love as we should love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we love, therefore, as god loves.",modern
rationalism,1674,"it is clear, therefore, that knowledge of truth and love of virtue together constitute our entire perfection, since they are the ordinary consequences of our union with god and give us possession of him to the extent to which we are the search after capable of it in this life.",modern
rationalism,1674,"they too are the consequences of a union of our mind with our body, as i have proved in several places while showing that we never know bulb or love",modern
rationalism,1674,"bose who best know the bulb and most love the goods worthiest of love are always more perfect than those in a state of blindness and disorder, but they are not always happier.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we do not consider that bodies can act on the mind only as occasional causes, that the mind cannot immediately or by itself possess anything corporeal and cannot unite itself to an object except through its knowledge and love, that only god is above it and can reward or punish it though sensations of pleasure or pain, or can enlighten or move it in a word, only he can act on it.",modern
rationalism,1674,"when we consider something as pan of ourselves or ourselves as pan of something else, we judge that our good consists in being joined it, we have a love for it, and our love increases as the thing in question seems to be a greater part of the whole that we make up together with it.",modern
rationalism,1674,the light of reason reveals to us a thousand reasons for loving only god and scorning bodies as unworthy of our love.,modern
rationalism,1674,for god as the author of nature leads minds to his love through enlightened knowledge and not by instinctive knowledge.,modern
rationalism,1674,"but as our sensations are more lively and more frequent, affect us more, and are even stronger than our illuminations, we should not be surprised that our sensations excite us and awaken our love for all sensible things, while our illuminations dissipate and vanish without arousing any desire in us for the truth.",modern
rationalism,1674,"it is true that many people believe that god is their true good, love him as their all, and fervently desire to increase and strengthen their union with him.",modern
rationalism,1674,"metaphysics, pure mathematics, and all the universal sciences that determine and contain the particular sciences as the universal being contains all particular beings seem chimerical to almost everyone to the pious as well as to those who have no love for god.",modern
rationalism,1674,and this is enough to lead them to love and serve him.,modern
rationalism,1674,"he wished to instruct them by means of what was blinding them; he wished to lead them to his love, to free them from sensible goods by means of the same things that were enslaving them.",modern
rationalism,1674,"they can know god through faith and love him with the help of grace without knowing that he is their all in the way in which philosophers can understand this, and without the thought dawning on them that abstract knowledge of truth is a kind of union with him.",modern
rationalism,1674,thus sensations are the only sensible proofs of our dependence on certain things for which they excite our love.,modern
rationalism,1674,"our natural union with god, therefore, does not excite our love for him.",modern
rationalism,1674,"hence, the union we have with our body, and through it with all sensible objects, excites a fervent love in us that increases this union and makes us depend on things infinitely below us.",modern
rationalism,1674,"part of the task of morals is to discover all the particular errors in which our passions involve us concerning the good; it is up to it to combat inordinate love, to restore the integrity of the heart, and to regulate morality.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but our main goal here is to control the mind and discover the causes of our errors with regard to truth; thus, we shall not pursue any further the things we have just mentioned, which are concerned only with the love of true good.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we are looking for the truth in itself and not in relation to us, and we shall consider the relation it has to us only because this relation causes self love to disguise the truth and hide it from us; for we judge all things according to our passions, and, as a result, we are deceived in all things, since judgments of passion are never in agreement with judgments of truth.",modern
rationalism,1674,"love and hate, he says, lcnow not how to judge according to the truth.",modern
rationalism,1674,"i judge only as i hear,' not as i hate or love or fear.",modern
rationalism,1674,"finally, here is a judgment of love (david speaking of his parricidal son): 'spare my son absalom.'''",modern
rationalism,1674,"our love, hatred, and fear make us judge only falsely; only the pure light of the truth enlightens our mind, and only the distinct voice of our common master makes us judge solidly provided that we judge only what he says to us",modern
rationalism,1674,"when we love someone, we are naturally led to believe that he loves us, and we find it somewhat difficult to imagine that he intends to harm us or oppose our wishes.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but if hatred follows our love, we cannot believe he wishes good for us; we interpret all his actions in the worst way, and we are always apprehensive and suspicious, although his only thought might be to help us.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we think they love what we love and desire what we desire, and from this our jealousies and secret aversions are generated if the good we seek cannot be entirely possessed by many people, for just the opposite happens when several people can possess a good without dividing it, such as with the sovereign good, science, virtue, and so on.",modern
rationalism,1674,"when we are moved by a passionate love for someone, we judge that everything about him deserves to be loved.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but if this friendship, which like all passions is based only on the agitation of the blood and animal spirits, begins to cool for lack of bodily heat or spirits to sustain it, or if some distraction or false relation alters the brain's disposition, the hatred replacing love will not fail to make us imagine all the defects to which we direct our aversion in the object of our passion.",modern
rationalism,1674,we shall be ashamed to have loved him; and the nowdominant passion will not fail to justify itself and ridicule the one whose place it has taken.,modern
rationalism,1674,our passions conceal not only their main object from us but also everything to which they have any relation; not only do they make us love all the qualities of our friends,modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, the impulse of love or hatred extends not only to the main object of passion but also to all objects seen as having some relation to this object, because the soul's impulse in passion follows the mind's perception, just as the motion of the animal spirits in the brain follows the traces in the brain both those that call up the main idea of the object of passion as well as those related to this idea.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we should not be surprised, then, if men's hatred or love goes to such lengths, or if their actions are very strange and unexpected.",modern
rationalism,1674,"love of pleasure is a natural inclination; this love does not depend on the body; therefore, it is common to all men.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but the love of music, dancing, or hunting is not universal, because the body's disposition on which it depends differs in all men, and so all the passions depending on it are not always the same.",modern
rationalism,1674,"in the search after this way it will be seen, as we shall explain below, that love and hatred are the two parent passions and that the only general passions they produce are desire, joy, and sadness, that the particular passions are composed only of these three primitive passions, and that they are compounded to the extent to which the principal idea of good or evil exciting them is accompanied by a greater number of ancillary ideas, or that the good and evil in question are more specified in relation to us.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for if we cannot see a man moved by some passion without receiving an impression of that passion or without in some way taking part in his sensations, how would it be possible for those who are surrounded by a great number of admirers not to accede to a passion that flatters self love so agreeably.",modern
rationalism,1674,"now the object of my wonder contains a sensible idea of greatness; i must therefore judge it according to this idea, for greatness must arouse my esteem and love.",modern
rationalism,1674,love and aversion are the first passions to follow wonder.,modern
rationalism,1674,we do not long consider an object without discovering the relations it has to us or to something that we love.,modern
rationalism,1674,"since the object that we love, and to which we are consequently joined by our love, is almost always present to us, as is the object of our wonder, our mind easily and without much thought makes the necessary comparisons to discover the relations they have between themselves and to us, or else it naturally receives this information from the prevenient sensations of pleasure and pain.",modern
rationalism,1674,then the impulse of love that we have for ourselves and for the object we love is extended to the object of our wonder if the relation in which it immediately stands to us or to some object joined to us appears to our advantage according to either our knowledge or sensation of it.,modern
rationalism,1674,"but if we sense through some pain, or if we discover through clear and certain knowledge, that being joined or related to the object of our wonder is disadvantageous to us or to something joined to us, then the impulse of love we have for ourselves and for the thing joined to us is either restricted to us or is directed toward the thing joined to us.",modern
rationalism,1674,this passion is entirely contrary to love.,modern
rationalism,1674,yet is never without love.,modern
rationalism,1674,"love and aversion, then, are the two contrary passions that give birth to all others; but jove is the first, chief, and most universal.",modern
rationalism,1674,"finally, the idea of a good we do not possess and do not hope to possess, or, what is to the same effect, the idea of a good we do not hope to possess without loss of some other good, or whose possession we cannot maintain, produces a melancholy love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, when i say that the possession of good produces joy, i mean not only possession in the sense of immediate union but all other kinds; for we naturally feel joy when those whom we love have good fortune.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but if by evil, pain is meant (which alone is always a real evil to those who suffer it, as long as they suffer it), then the sensation of this evil produces sadness and the desire for the elimination of this evil passions that are sorts of aversion rather than love, for their impulse is entirely opposed to that accompanying the perception of good; their impulse is only the soul's opposition to a natural impression,.e.,",modern
rationalism,1674,"lastly, if by evil is meant the person or thing that deprives us of good or that makes us suffer pain, the idea of evil produces either an impulse of love and aversion together or simply an impulse of aversion.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the idea of evil produces an impulse of love and aversion together when the evil deprives us of good, for by the same impulse we tend toward the good and flee from what prevents its possession.",modern

rationalism,1674,"vanity triumphs over their natural sloth, but sloth, in tum, triumphs over their love for truth: for vanity sometimes stands up against sloth, but sloth is nearly always victorious over love of truth.",modern
rationalism,1674,"because men's perception since the time of their first father's sin has been too weak to consider the truth in itself, this sovereign truth has made itself sensible by investing itself with our humanity in order to attract our attention, to enlighten us, and to make itself worthy of love to our eyes.",modern

rationalism,1674,"but the philosophy that is called new, which is represented as a specter to frighten feeble minds, which is scorned and condemned without being understood, the new philosophy, i say (since it is the fashion to call it thus), ruins all the arguments of the skeptics through the establishment of the greatest of its principles, which is in perfect hannony with the first principle of the christian religion: that we must love and fear only one god, since there is only one god who can make us happy.",modern
rationalism,1674,"finally, if religion teaches us that we must not genuflect before false gods, this philosophy also teaches us that our imaginations and minds must not bow before the imaginary greatness and power of causes that are not causes at all; that we must neither love nor fear them; that we must not be concerned with them; that we must think only of god alone, see god in all things, fear and love god in all things.",modern

rationalism,1674,"some of the most general of these principles of morality are: that god, having made all things for himself, made our minds to know him and our hearts to love him; that being as powerful and as just as he is, we cannot be happy unless we follow his orders, nor unhappy if we follow them; that our nature is corrupt, our minds depend on our bodies, our reason on our senses, our will on our passions; that we are powerless to do what we clearly see to be our duty, and that we need a liberator.",modern

rationalism,1674,"thus, wanting to be loved by us, it was necessary that he make himself sensible and present himselfbefore us, to stop, through the sweetness of his grace, all our vain agitations, and to begin our healing by sensations or delights similar to the prevenient pleasures that had begun our illness.",modern

rationalism,1674,"but since a particular good does not contain all other goods, and since the mind when it considers this good clearly and distinctly cannot believe that it contains them all, god does not lead us either necessarily or invincibly to the love of this good.",modern

rationalism,1674,"now since we can love only objeclo; that we can think about, and since we presently cannot think about objects other than those which cause exceedingly lively sensations in us, it is clear that our dependence on the body diminishes our freedom and in many cases even prevents ilo; use altogether.",modern
rationalism,1674,"god is not the author of sin because he constantly impresses the impulse to continue on whoever sins or stops at some particular good, because he gives the sinner the power of thinking of other things and of proceeding to goods other than the one that is actually the object of his thought and love, because he commands him not to love whatever he can refuse to love without being troubled by remorse, and because he unceasingly reminds him of himself through the secret reproaches of his reason.",modern
rationalism,1674,"it is true that in a sense god leads the sinner to love the object of his sin; for, as practically all theologians put it, whatever matter, act, or impulse there is in sin comes from god.",modern
rationalism,1674,"man's sin consists in the fact that he does not relate all particular goods to the sovereign good, or rather in that he does not consider and love the sovereign good in particular goods, and thus does not regulate his love according to the will of god, or according to that necessary and essential order which all men know the more perfectly as they are more closely united with god and less sensitive to the impressions of their senses and passions.",modern
rationalism,1674,"nor does man give himself new modifications that materially change or modify his substance, for the impulse of love, which god unceasingly impresses in us, neither increases nor diminishes, whether we are actually loving or not,.e., whether or not this natural impulse of love is determined by some particular idea of our mind.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we are not even aware of our habits, and whether we are worthy of the love or wrath of god.",modern

rationalism,1674,"now when we love a particular good by itself or contrary to order, we receive from god as great an impression of love as if we did not pause over this good.",modern

rationalism,1674,"nor is the impulse evil, since it is not different from the impulse of love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"and the sinner can hate god only by making abominable use of the impulse he constantly gives him to lead him to his love; and he can so misuse it only because he confusedly perceives and falsely judges that god is not good, and ceases to examine the false reasons that lead him to believe that creatures rather than the creator are the causes of his happiness.",modern
rationalism,1674,"in short, only in moral evil, or the disorder of the sinner's love, does god have no part.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the soul's pleasure, as well as its impulse or its love, is materially good; and there is no good that god fails to do.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the same is true of the will; this faculty is but the soul itself insofar as it loves its perfection and happiness, insofar as it wills to be happy, or insofar as through the impulse god constantly impresses in it for the good in general it is made capable of loving everything that appears to it to be good.",modern
rationalism,1674,"on the following passage from the fifth chapter: this being so, adam cannot be said to have been brought to love of god and to his duty by pre enient pleasures, because the knowledge he had of his good and the joy he continually felt as a necessary result of the perception of his happiness in being united to god could have sufficed to attract him to his duty and make him act more meritoriously than if he had been determined, as it were, by prevenient pleasure.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for if we begin to love an object, we do so either because we know through reason that it is good or because we experience through sensation that it is pleasant.",modern
rationalism,1674,illumination enlightens our mind and makes us aware of the good without actually or efficaciously leading us to love it.,modern
rationalism,1674,"pleasure, on the contrary, both moves us and efficaciously determines us to love the object seeming to cause it.",modern
rationalism,1674,"illumination does not lead us by itself; it merely permits us to lead ourselves, freely and by ourselves, to the good it presents to us when we already love it; illumination leaves us entirely to ourselves.",modern
rationalism,1674,"pleasure, on the contrary, precedes our reason; it prevents us from consulting it and makes us love by instinct; it does not leave us entirely to ourselves and it weakens our freedom.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, since before sin adam was destined in time to merit eternal happiness, and since for this reason his freedom was complete and hs illumination sufficient to keep him closely joined to god (whom he already loved through the natural impulse of his love), he did not have to be inclined to his duty through prevenient pleasures, which would have diminished his merit by diminishing his freedom.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for since pleasure produces and maintains love of the things causing it or seeming to cause it, the prevenient pleasures we receive upon occasion of the presence of bodies produce and maintain cupidity in us.",modern
rationalism,1674,"and it seems to me clearly beyond doubt that a man who has the love of elucidations of the search after god in his heart can by the strength of his habitual love excited by the knowledge of his duty, and without prevenient delight, give a sou, for example, to a poor man, or patiently suffer some minor injustice.",modern
rationalism,1674,"it seems to me that delight is necessary only when temptation is strong or love weak,",modern
rationalism,1674,"it is true that delight or actual grace is necessary for any good action if by the word delight or grace is meant charity that is actually excited, or the delight that accompanies it, as saint augustine generally understands it, for clearly anything that is in no way done for love of god is worth nothing.",modern
rationalism,1674,pleasure and love are assumed to be the same thing because one is almost never found without the other and because saint augustine does not always distinguish them.,modern
rationalism,1674,for we certainly will what we love; we can also say that we would not be able to do anything good or meritorious without delight or charity.,modern
rationalism,1674,"but i hope to show in an elucidation that i shall give on the treatise on the passio that there is as great a difference between pleasure and love, voluntary or involuntary, as there is between our knowledge and our love, or to explain this difference more sensibly, as there is between the figure of a body and its motion.",modern
rationalism,1674,one necessary love that is the principle of all created wills?,modern
rationalism,1674,"god creates and preserves the mind of man in order that it be concerned with him, know him, and love him, for the end of god's works is god.",modern
rationalism,1674,god cannot will that we love what is not worthy of love or that what is least worthy of love be most loved.,modern
rationalism,1674,"corrupt and in a state of disorder, because the mind is naturally led to love bodies that are not worthy of love or have no efficacy for acting on it, and because the mind often loves them more than god himself.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, false good must be discerned through a prevenient sensation in order to be loved by an instinctive love, and true good must be known through clear knowledge in order to be loved by a free and rational love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"finally, god creates and preserves man in order to be known and loved by him; therefore, his mind's capacity must not be filled, even partially and in spite of himself, by knowledge of the infinite configurations and figures of the bodies surrounding him and of the one he animates.",modern
rationalism,1674,"furthermore, all the love that god places in us must end in him, for god produces nothing in us that is not for him.",modern
rationalism,1674,"finally, bodies are not worthy of love; they are below what in us is capable of loving.",modern
rationalism,1674,"therefore, in nature's first institution bodies were unable to tum the mind toward them or lead it to consider and love them as goods.",modern
rationalism,1674,"it is natural to love pleasure and to enjoy it, and this was not forbidden to adam.",modern
rationalism,1674,"since the first man did not have the capacity of an infinite mind, his pleasure or joy diminished the mind's clear perception, which informed him that god was his good, the sole cause of his pleasures and joy, and that he was to love only him.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we can see, then, that since the first man let his mind's capacity be gradually shared or filled by the lively sensation of a presumptuous joy, or perhaps by some sensible pleasure or love, god's presence and the thought of his duty were erased from his mind because he failed to courageously follow his light in the search for his true good.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, he should have loved only him, since only the true cause of our happiness should be loved.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but because it is a disorder for the mind to be turned toward bodies and to love them, the child is a sinner and in a state of disorder as soon as it is created.",modern
rationalism,1674,"god, who loves order, hates the child in this state.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for when we consider the perfection of our own being, it is difficult to despise ourselves unless we at the same time see and love the sovereign good in the presence of which all our perfection and grandeur dissipates and is destroyed.",modern
rationalism,1674,"there remains in their will only natural love, and this love is disordered.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, there is nothing in them that god can love, because god cannot love disorder.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but when they have been reborn in jesus christ, that is, when their heart has been turned toward god either by an actual impulse of love or, rather, by a habit, or an inner disposition, such as results from a perfect act of love of god, then concupiscence is no longer sinful in them, for concupiscence is no longer alone in their heart and no longerdominates it.",modern
rationalism,1674,habitual love that remains in them through the grace of baptism in jesus christ is freer or stronger than the love that is in them through the concupiscence they have from adam.,modern
rationalism,1674,and it should not be considered very strange if i say that it could even happen that at the time children are baptized they love god with a voluntary love.,modern
rationalism,1674,"elucidations of the search after given that the second adam is the opposite of the first, why could he not, at the time of rebirth, deliver children from the servitude of their bodies to which they are subject only because of the first adam, in order that, enlightened and moved by a lively and efficacious grace to love god, they should all love him with a free and rational love, without the first adam preventing them from doing so.",modern
rationalism,1674,only a single instant is needed to perform this act of love that changes the heart.,modern
rationalism,1674,"for when there are two different loves in one heart, one natural and the other voluntary, order would have it that only the love that is voluntary should be valued.",modern
rationalism,1674,"and if at baptism children loved god by an act that was in no way free (subsequently loving bodies by many acts of the same kind), order would perhaps not permit god to value a single act more than many acts all of which were natural and involuntary.",modern
rationalism,1674,"or rather, if these opposing loves were of equal strength, he would value the one that was later for the same reason that when there have been two successive, opposing loves in a single heart, god always values the later because grace is lost through a single mortal sin.",modern
rationalism,1674,"nevertheless, it cannot and should not be denied that god can, without suspending thedomination of its body over its mind, lead the child into righteousness, or tum its will toward him, by placing in its soul a disposition like the one found after an actual impulse of love for god.",modern
rationalism,1674,"god cannot view as righteous and love creatures that are at the same time in a state of disorder, although, because of jesus christ, he can intend to restore them to order and to love them when they have been so restored.",modern
rationalism,1674,"if god wills that minds should be subject to bodies and that they should love and fear them, this would not be a state of disorder.",modern
rationalism,1674,"he is indeed able not to produce anything external to himself; but if he wills to act, he can do so only according to the immutable order of wisdom that he necessarily loves.",modern
rationalism,1674,"this learned man did not notice that there was an order, a law, a sovereign reason that god necessarily loves, which is coeternal with him and according to which he necessarily acts, given that he wills to act.",modern
rationalism,1674,"i maintain only that god can neither create nor conserve minds in order for them to know and love creatures as their good or the cause of their happiness, because creatures are not their good or the cause of their happiness.",modern
rationalism,1674,"it is an immutable, eternal, and necessary law that they should know and love god as i have explained in the third article.",modern
rationalism,1674,"i reply, second, that it is not true that the soul's pleasure is the same thing as its impulse or its love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"a pleasure and love are two modes of the soul, but pleasure has no necessary relation to the object seeming to cause it, while love is necessarily related to the good.",modern
rationalism,1674,"pleasure is to the soul what figure is to body, and motion is to body what love is to the soul.",modern
rationalism,1674,"i reply, finally, that even if pleasure were not different from the soul's impulse or love, the pleasure felt by the first man while making use of corporeal goods would not have led him to love these bodies.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but it is clear (i) that the immutable order demands that the body be subject to the mind, and that it is a contradiction that god should not love and will order.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for god necessarily loves his son, that wisdom to whom he communicates his entire substance.",modern
rationalism,1674,whal order is and why god necessarily loves il.,modern
rationalism,1674,"god loves only order; the sinner is not in a state of order; therefore, god does not love the sinner.",modern
rationalism,1674,"the sinner cannot subsist, then, since creatures subsist only because god wills that they be and because god does not will that they be unless he loves them.",modern
rationalism,1674,for it seems to me you cannot give a clearer idea of righteousness and rectitude than by saying that a will is virtuous when it loves god and that it is disordered when it is turned toward bodies.,modern
rationalism,1674,"now, this unworthiness, which, as i have already shown, consists in the fact that the inclinations of children are actually corrupt and that their heart is turned toward bodies that they love, is really in them.",modern
rationalism,1674,i even believe that the habit of their charity was not preceded by any act of love of god.,modern
rationalism,1674,"but if you see that it is necessary to give a more precise explanation than is given, for example, by saint augustine in some places (which suppor imputation, although he elsewhere speaks in a way that does not supportb it); if you consider that imputation is convenient and that for this reason it seems to have been accepted by certain ancient and very orthodox theologians, and that it is absolutely necessary to those who deny, although unjustifiably, habits in the soul (and who at the same time deny that children are capable of actuallove) whom it is perhaps good to satisfy if we can; finally, if you wish to respect the natural fairness that prohibits condemning secret intentions, you will perhaps be able to judge that what i say is not likely.",modern
rationalism,1674,but perhaps they are like those judicious people who greatly love truth but who nonetheless are not insensible to manners.,modern
rationalism,1674,"we always reduce mathematical truths and ratios to their exponents,.e., the simplest terms expressing them, and we free them from everything that might confuse and obscure them, for geometers love the pure truth; they do not wish to convince by impression, but by evidence and light.",modern

rationalism,1674,"i prefer to be called a visionary, or one of the illuminati, or any ofthe lovely things with which the imagination (always sarcastic in insignificant minds) usually answers arguments it does not understand and against which it is defenseless, than to agree that bodies can enlighten me, that i am my own master, reason, and light, and that in order to be well versed in anything i need only consult myself or other men who can perhaps fill my ears with noise, but who certainly cannot fill my mind with light.",modern
rationalism,1674,"furthermore, given that we can love only what we see, it is clear that if god gave us only particular ideas he would determine all the impulses of our will in such a way that we could love only particular beings.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for in the final analysis, if we did not have an idea of the infinite, we could not love it; and if those who assert that they have no idea of god spoke the truth, i would not hesitate in saying that they never have loved god, for it appears to me quite certain that one can love only what one sees.",modern
rationalism,1674,"how will you prove to him that it is a disorder for minds to be subordinated to bodies unless you have a clear idea of order and its necessity, unless you know that god himself is constrained to follow this order by the necessary love he bears for himself?",modern
rationalism,1674,for what makes a man moral is that he loves order and conforms his will to it in all things just as the sinner is such only because he does not find order pleasing in all things and because he would have order conform to his own wishes.,modern
rationalism,1674,"it must be considered, then, that god loves himself with a necessary love, and that thus he loves what in him represents or contains greater perfection more than what contains less so much so that if we wish to suppose an intelligible mind to be a thousand times more perfect than an intelligible body, the love by which god loves himself would necessarily be a thousand times greater for the intelligible mind than for the intelligible body; for god's love is necessarily proportionate to the order among the intelligible beings he contains, since he necessarily loves his own perfections.",modern
rationalism,1674,"as a result of this, the order that is purely speculative has the force of law with regard to god himself, given, as is certainly the case, that god necessarily loves himself and that he cannot contradict himself.",modern
rationalism,1674,"furthermore, god cannot love intelligible bodies more than intelligible minds, although he can love created bodies more than minds, as i shall soon show.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for, since god has created us in his image and likeness, he cannot will that we love more what deserves to be loved less he wills that our will conform with his and that here below we freely and hence meritoriously render things the justice that he necessarily renders them.",modern
rationalism,1674,"his law, the immutable order of his perfections, is therefore also ours; and this order is not unknown to us, and even our natural love excites us to follow it when we retreat within ourselves and our senses and passions leave us free in short, when our self love does not corrupt our natural love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"and we are naturally led to love it, for it is his light that illumines us and his love that animates us (although our senses and passions obscure this light",modern
rationalism,1674,"however, in spite of concupiscence, which conceals order from us and prevents us from following it, order is always a law that is essential and without exception with regard to us, and not only with regard to us but to all created intelligences and even the damned for i do not think that they are so removed from god that they do not yet have some faint idea of order in which they find some beauty and that they are not perhaps even ready to conform themselves to it in certain particular cases where their self love is not at stake.",modern
rationalism,1674,"perhaps, then, we can now sec the nature of the immutable order of justice and how this order has the force of law through the necessary love that god has for himself.",modern
rationalism,1674,"nonetheless, if you consider that god has not and cannot have any law other than his wisdom and the necessary love he has for it, you will easily judge that all the divine laws must depend on it.",modern
rationalism,1674,"and if you take note that he created the world only in relation to this wisdom and love (since he acts only for himself), you will have no doubt that all natural laws must tend to the preservation and perfection of this world according to indispensable order and depending upon necessary love for the wisdom and will of god rule all things.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for since god cannot act in ignorance and in spite of himself, he created the world according to wisdom and through the impulse of his love",modern
rationalism,1674,"now, in the wisdom of god, minds are more perfect than bodies; and as a result ofthe necessary love that god has for himself, he prefers the more perfect to the less perfect.",modern
rationalism,1674,"otherwise we would have to say that in creating the world god did not follow the direction of his eternal wisdom, nor the impulses of his natural and necessary love, which is inconceiveable and which even contains a manifest contradiction.",modern
rationalism,1674,"this is because god, whose self love is a necessary love and is always his inviolable law, cannot love minds that arc opposed to him; consequently, he cannot prefer them to bodies in which there is nothing that is evil or that he hates.",modern

rationalism,1674,but when will men love only the truth?,modern
rationalism,1674,"he can do so if he wills to do so, but he cannot will to do so, nor even hesitate to will not to do so, because he has no motive for this and because he has invincible motives for being attached to his beloved master and his god.",modern
rationalism,1674,"any man, for example, who knows how to retreat within himself and who quiets the din of his senses and passions discovers clearly that the entire impulse of love that god places in us must center upon him, and that god himself cannot dispense us from the obligation we have of loving him in all things.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for i do not see how it can be imagined that god can will that we love most what is least worthy of love, or that we should love supremely, or as our end, what is not supremely worthy of love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"and that he has reiterated for us through his son in the gospel: you shall love the lord your god with your whole heart, your whole soul, your whole mind and your whole strength.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but because order would have it that every righteous person should be happy and every sinner miserable, that every action conforming to order or every impulse of love toward god should be rewarded, and that every action contrary to order or every impulse of love not tending toward god should be punished, it is clear that every man wishing to be happy must unceasingly strive after god and must recoil from every obstacle in his path or anything that diminishes his impulse toward his true good.",modern

rationalism,1674,"we deceive ourselves, and god permits us to do so, but we do not deceive him who fathoms the depths of our heart; and though we may close our ears as tightly as we can to the voice of inner truth, because sovereign reproaches us by abandoning us to ourselves, we are still aware that it lights our darkness and reveals the strategems of our self love.",modern
rationalism,1674,that love is different from pleasure and joy.,modern
rationalism,1674,"but such is not the case with pleasure and love, which are almost always confused.",modern
rationalism,1674,"as a result, this impulse of love occuring in the soul while it feels the pleasure suffices for it to confuse its pleasure with its love because it has a clear idea of neither its love nor its pleasure as it does of some figure or an instance of motion.",modern
rationalism,1674,"because of this, some people believe that pleasure and love are not different and that i make too many distinctions in each of our passions.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but in order to show clearly that pleasure and love arc two very different things, i shall distinguish two kinds of pleasure.",modern
rationalism,1674,"it is perhaps clear from this distinction between pleasure that follows reason and pleasure that precedes it, that there is no pleasure that is not different from love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for the pleasure that precedes reason certainly precedes love, since it precedes all knowledge, whereas some knowledge is presupposed by love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"and joy, on the contrary, or pleasure that presupposes know ledge also presupposes love, since joy presupposes the confused sensation or clear knowledge that we possess or will possess of what we love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"for if we possessed something for which we had no love, we would receive no joy from it.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, pleasure is quite different from love because the pleasure that precedes reason precedes and causes love, and the pleasure that follows reason necessarily presupposes love as the effect presupposes its cause.",modern
rationalism,1674,"now, there is a big difference between the soul's perceptions on the one hand and its impulses and love on the other.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, natural love is quite different from prevenient pleasure, although it always accompanies it.",modern
rationalism,1674,"yet a christian voluntarily loves his enemy, and a well brought up child loves his father, however unreasonable or vexing he might be.",modern
rationalism,1674,"but this pleasure is clearly very different from the love they have for their father, although it might be the motive for it.",modern
rationalism,1674,"elucidations of the search after it is also quite certain that habitual love is different from pleasure, for this love continues in us during distractions and during sleep.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, given that habitual love or charity reside in us without pleasure or delight, it cannot be maintained that pleasure and love are but the same thing.",modern
rationalism,1674,"as pleasure and pain are contraries, if pleasure were the same thing as love, pain would not be different from hatred.",modern
rationalism,1674,"pain, then, is not hatred, and pleasure, which is the contrary of pain, is not love, which is the contrary of hatred.",modern
rationalism,1674,"and consequently, the pleasure that precedes reason is not the same thing as love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"i shall now likewise prove that joy, or the pleasure that follows reason, is distinct from love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"as joy and sadness are contraries, if joy were the same thing as love, sadness would not be different from hatred.",modern
rationalism,1674,"true, the man hates the privation of the good he loves; but it is clear that this kind of hatred is really love, because the man hates the privation of good only because he loves good.",modern
rationalism,1674,"and since fleeing from the privation of good is to tend toward good, it is clear that the impulse of his hatred is not different from the impulse of his love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, given that his hatred, if he has any, is not contrary to love, whereas sadness is always contrary to joy, it is clear that this sadness is not his hatred and consequently, joy is different from love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"finally, it is clear that we are affected by sadness due to the presence of some object we hate, or rather due to the absence of some object we love.",modern
rationalism,1674,"thus, sadness presupposes hatred or, rather, love, but it is very different from these two things.",modern
rationalism,1674,"i realize that saint augustine asserts that pain is an aversion conceived by the soul due to the fact that the body is not disposed as it would wish, and that he often confuses delight with charity, pleasure with joy, pain with sadness, pleasure and joy with love, and pain and sadness with aversion or hatred.",modern
rationalism,1674,"we should see god in all things, sense his power and might in all natural effects, admire his wisdom in the marvelous order of creatures in a word, we should adore only him, fear and love only him in all his works.",modern

analytic,1912,"thus it is easier to account for falsehood if we take judgement to be a relation in which the mind and the various objects concerned all occur severally; that is to say, desdemona and loving and cassio must all be terms in the relation which subsists when othello believes that desdemona loves cassio.",contemporary

german_idealism,1788,"principles of self love can indeed contain universal rules of skill (for discovering means to one's aims), but then they are merely theoretical principl (e.g., how someone who would like to eat bread has to devise a mill).",modern

german_idealism,1788,"thus we comprehend how it is possible to a priori that the moral law inasmuch as it excludes the inclinations and the propensity to make them the supreme practical condition,.e., self love, from any participati in the supreme legislation can exert on feeling an effect that on the one hand is merely negative but on the other hand, specifically in regard to the restricting basis of pure practical reason, is positive; and for this no special kind of feeling need be assumed, under the name of a practical or moral feeling, as preceding the moral law and lying at its basis.",modern
german_idealism,1788,"for, the presentation of the moral law deprives self love of its influence and self conceit of its delusion; and thereby pure practical reason's obstacle is diminished and the presentation of the superiority of its objective law to the impulses of sensibility is produced, and hence by the removal of the counterweight so is, relatively, the law's weight (with regard to a will affected by sensibility) in the judgment of reason.",modern
german_idealism,1788,"and thus respect for the law is not an incentive to morality; rather, it is morality itself regarded subjectively as an incentive inasmuch as pure practical reason by rejecting, in contrast to self love, all of self love's claims imparts authori to the law, which now alone has cf.",modern

german_idealism,1788,"with this, however, the possibility of such a comma as love god above all and your neighbor as yourself agrees quite well.",modern

german_idealism,1788,therefore it is only practical love which is understood in that kernel of all laws.,modern
german_idealism,1788,"to love god, in this signification, means to fulfill his commands gladly; to love one's neighbor means to perform all duty toward him gladly.",modern
german_idealism,1788,"hence they always make it necessary for the creature on account of them, to base the attitude of his maxims on moral necessitation .e., not on willing acquiescence but on respect, which demands compliance with the law even if this were done reluctant rather than on love, which does not gerne, also rendered as 'being glad to' below.",modern
german_idealism,1788,"yet they also make it necessary for the creature to make this love viz., mere love for the law (since this law would then cease to be a command, and since morality, which would now subjectively pass over into holiness, would cease to be virtue) the constant though unattainable goal of his endeavor.",modern
german_idealism,1788,"for in what we highly esteem but yet dread (because of the consciousness of our weaknesses), the greater ease in satisfying it results in the reverential dread's being transformed into fondness, and respect into love; at least this would be the perfection of an attitude devoted to the law, if it were ever possible for a creature to attain it.",modern
german_idealism,1788,"this consideration is aimed not so much at bringing the just cited gospel command to distinct concepts in order to restrain or, if possible, forestall religious fanaticism in regard to the love of god, but at accurately determining the moral attitude directly in regard to our duties toward human beings as well, and to restrain or, if possible, forestall a merely moral fanaticism that infects many minds.",modern

feminism,1949,"she cheerfully accepts these lies because they invite her to take the easy slope: and that is the worst of the crimes committed against her; from her childhood and throughout her life, she is spoiled, she is corrupted by the fact that this resignation, tempting to any existent anxious about her freedom, is meant to be her vocation; if one encourages a child to be lazy by entertaining him all day, without giving him the occasion to study, without showing him its value, no one will say when he reaches the age of man that he chose to be incapable and ignorant; this is how the woman is raised, without ever being taught the necessity of assuming her own existence; she readily lets herself count on the protection, love, help, and guidance of others; she lets herself be fascinated by the hope of being able to realize her being without doing anything.",contemporary

feminism,1949,"of course this explanation is somewhat humorous; but except in cases of jealous and exclusive passion where the man wants the woman in her entirety this conflict, in tenderness, desire, even love, is always present; the man always has 'something else to do' with his time, whereas she is trying to get rid of hers; and he does not consider the hours she devotes to him as a gift but as a burden.",contemporary
feminism,1949,"this explains the cruelty of which the woman often shows herself capable; she feels 'self righteous' because she has the bad role; she does not feel any obligation to accommodate the privileged caste, she thinks only of defending herself; she will even be very happy if she has the opportunity to display her resentment to the lover who has not been able to satisfy her: since he does not give enough, she will take everything back with fierce pleasure.",contemporary

feminism,1949,"many modern women who claim their dignity as human beings still grasp their sexual lives by referring back to a tradition of slavery: so it seems humiliating to them to lie under the man and be penetrated by him, and they tense up into frigidity; but if reality were different, the meaning sexual gestures and postures symbolically express would be different as well: a woman who pays, whodominates her lover, can, for example, feel proud of her superb inertia and think that she is enslaving the male who is actively exerting himself; and today there are already many sexually balanced couples for whom notions of victory and defeat yield to an idea of exchange.",contemporary
feminism,1949,"the fact is that this sacrifice appears particularly heavy to men; few of them really wish in their hearts to see women accomplish themselves; those who scorn woman do not see what they would have to gain, and those who cherish her see too well what they have to lose; and it is true that presentday developments not only threaten feminine charm: in deciding to live for herself, woman will abdicate the functions as double and mediator that provide her with her privileged place within the masculine universe; for the man caught between the silence of nature and the demanding presence of other freedoms, a being who is both his peer and a passive thing appears as a great treasure; he may well perceive his companion in a mythical form, but the experiences of which she is the source or pretext are no less real: and there are hardly more precious, intimate, or urgent ones; it cannot be denied that feminine dependence, inferiority, and misfortune give women their unique character; assuredly, women's autonomy, even if it spares men a good number of problems, will also deny them many conveniences; assuredly, there are certain ways of living the sexual adventure that will be lost in the world of tomorrow: but this does not mean that love, happiness, poetry, and dreams will be banished from it.",contemporary
