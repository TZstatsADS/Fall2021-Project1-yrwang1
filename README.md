### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: A "Data Story" on the History of Philosophy - What Philosophers Say about Love
+ This project is conducted by [Yarong Wang]

+ Project summary: It is undeniable that love plays an essential role in our life; we find it discussed in songs, movies, novels, in every corner of life. The nature of love has been a mainstay in philosophy since the time of the Ancient Greeks. This report explores what philosophers say about love. First, the raw data 'philosophy_data.csv' saved in data file is processed by filtering keywords and removing stopwords. Then, the report focuses on what philosophers from different schools and periods say about love, find the common characteristics and compare the difference. And finally, conclusions are made based on the above findings.
